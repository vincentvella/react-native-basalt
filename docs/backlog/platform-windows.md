# Windows, the platform

Part of the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md). Not scheduled.

**Open (8):**

1. The Hermes patch is applied by hand and nothing reapplies it
2. React Native's own warnings are not enforced on Windows
3. `offsetPoint` is page coordinates on all three platforms
4. `BASALT_SNAPSHOT` cannot see a `<TextInput>` on Windows
5. A `<TextInput>` on Windows is always on top of everything
6. The Windows choreographer is a 16ms timer
7. `scripts/integration_test.py` skips Fast Refresh on Windows
8. Nothing makes a red build hard to ignore

Since phase 47 Windows is a peer rather than a port in progress. It mounts every
component the other two desktops do -- `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image>`,
`<ScrollView>` and `<TextInput>` -- and Hermes evaluates a bundle, Fabric diffs
a shadow tree, Direct2D paints it in an HWND, a click on a `<Pressable>` runs
its `onPress`, a wheel scrolls a list, and a character typed into a field
reaches React and comes back. It runs the same end-to-end suite, it has a
`run-windows`, and `compare_hosts.sh` knows how to run it.

Struck-through entries below are what that took, kept because the order they
were done in is the useful part. What is not struck through is real and named,
and none of it is a missing half.

- ~~**No mounting manager.**~~ Phase 42. Phase 19 had already done the expensive
  part: the mutation walk is portable, so what Windows owed was seven operations
  and a props translation, and `core/MountingWalk.h` was not modified.
- ~~**React Native's C++ core has never been compiled with MSVC.**~~ It has, in
  phase 41: 442 objects, `basalt_core.lib`, every translation unit in
  ReactCommon, ReactCxxPlatform, folly and Yoga under clang-cl. What is left of
  it is below.
- ~~**Hermes does not build from source on Windows.**~~ It does, with three
  fixes, and it had to: the prebuilt everyone else consumes cannot be used here.
  `Microsoft.JavaScript.Hermes` ships jsi headers with no `IRuntime` at all and
  React Native 0.87's have 186 references to it, so every JSI symbol mangles
  differently. That is structural rather than bad luck -- react-native-windows
  targets React Native 0.84 and react-native-macos 0.81, and this is on 0.87, so
  nobody has built the prebuilt yet. `supported-versions.json` says Windows is a
  platform with a prebuilt Hermes; that is true in general and false for any
  React Native newer than the forks, and it should say so.
- **The Hermes patch is applied by hand and nothing reapplies it.**
  `HERMES_EMPTY_BASES` has to be added to `VM::Environment` in
  `include/hermes/VM/Callable.h`, and `third_party/hermes` is a downloaded
  tarball that `bootstrap.sh --force` deletes. Until bootstrap applies it, a
  fresh checkout gets a Hermes that fails on a static assertion. Upstream should
  take this: the macro is defined in `Support/Compiler.h` for exactly this
  purpose, with a comment naming `HERMESVM_CONTIGUOUS_HEAP`, and is applied to
  nothing in the entire tree.
- **React Native's own warnings are not enforced on Windows.** Its CMake applies
  `-Wall -Werror -Wpedantic`, all of which clang-cl either misreads or takes
  from an INTERFACE property that lands after anything that could counteract
  them, so phase 41 strips them. Linux stays the build that guards upstream
  warning cleanliness. Restoring them properly means `/clang:-Wall` or an
  equivalent that survives the link graph, and has not been attempted.
- ~~**`native/bootstrap.sh` has no Windows path.**~~ It has one, and it was run
  end to end: it detects Git Bash, finds a vcpkg that actually has the packages,
  patches Hermes, builds it with the three Windows flags, and prints a configure
  line that works. What it does **not** do is install anything -- vcpkg and its
  packages are still a manual prerequisite, and so is a Node new enough for
  React Native 0.87, which wants `^22.13 || ^24.3 || >= 26` and is not what a
  machine is likely to have.
- ~~**Nothing has run bootstrap from an empty `third_party`** on Windows.~~
  Done while writing the full Windows CI job, which would have been the first
  thing to do it -- and the entry was right to worry. Every earlier bootstrap
  had found Hermes already built by hand, so its configure step had never run,
  and it failed on its first real execution: Git Bash's MSYS runtime rewrites
  an argument that looks like an absolute POSIX path, `/DWIN32` looks exactly
  like one, and clang-cl was handed `C:/Program Files/Git/DWIN32`. The fix
  excludes that one argument from conversion rather than all of them, because
  the `-S` and `-B` paths beside it are only correct *because* of the same
  conversion; turning it off wholesale was the first attempt and broke those
  instead. From empty it now fetches, patches and builds Hermes, installs yarn
  and runs codegen with no errors.
- ~~**`<Text>`**~~ (phase 40, over DirectWrite) and ~~**`<Image>`**~~ (phase 40,
  over WIC, with the fetch shared from `core/ImageBytes.cpp`).
- ~~**Accessibility.**~~ Phase 40, over UI Automation -- the one place Windows
  is structurally different rather than differently spelled, since UIA wants a
  provider object where GTK and AppKit take properties on a view. What is left
  of it is `IRawElementProviderFragment` and the control patterns, both of which
  need the HWND fragment root and so belong with a later phase of the host.
- ~~**No input at all.**~~ Phase 44. `Win32TouchDispatcher` turns
  `WM_LBUTTONDOWN`/`WM_MOUSEMOVE`/`WM_LBUTTONUP` into React Native touches, and
  `js/press.js` counts presses on Windows. What is still missing is what a mouse
  has and a finger does not: **no right button**; **no keyboard**, which arrives
  with `<TextInput>` because there is nothing yet that focus could belong to. The
  wheel is not among them any more -- phase 45 took it, and routed it through
  the mounting manager rather than the touch dispatcher, because what it needs
  is the list of tags that are ScrollViews.
- **`offsetPoint` is page coordinates on all three platforms.** A touch should
  carry its position relative to the view it hit, and instead carries it
  relative to the surface root. Pressability does not read it, which is why
  nothing has noticed. On Windows the fix is cheap and was left out for
  symmetry: the hit chain the dispatcher already builds for gestures carries
  exactly the origin needed, so it only has to be built for touches too --
  which means paying for it on every press rather than only when RNGH is
  attached.
- ~~**No `<ScrollView>` on Windows.**~~ Phase 45. What it does not have is
  scrollbars, momentum, and a precision touchpad -- a Windows touchpad reports
  through `WM_POINTER*` rather than `WM_MOUSEWHEEL`, so a two-finger scroll
  arrives as notches like a wheel rather than as pixels, which neither other
  desktop confuses. `SPI_GETWHEELSCROLLLINES` is ignored on purpose so that one
  notch moves the same distance on all three.
- ~~**No `<TextInput>` on Windows.**~~ Phase 46, over a real `EDIT` control.
  Windows now mounts all five components the other two desktops do. What it
  does not have is multiline, `onKeyPress`, `onSelectionChange`, a tab order, or
  the colours the cue banner and the selection take from the system -- and a
  field with no `backgroundColor` paints the system window colour, because a
  child window cannot see through itself to what Direct2D drew behind it.
- **`BASALT_SNAPSHOT` cannot see a `<TextInput>` on Windows.** It renders the
  `RnWin32View` tree offscreen and a text field's peer is a child window, not a
  view -- so a field comes out as its background with no text, no placeholder
  and no caret. Not a bug in the snapshot, but it does mean the one host that
  can assert on pixels cannot assert on the one component whose appearance is
  hardest to get right. `PrintWindow` on the live window is the answer and
  nothing in the repository does it yet.
- **A `<TextInput>` on Windows is always on top of everything.** Its peer is a
  child window, so a later sibling cannot cover it and it does not clip to a
  scrolled ancestor -- it is hidden when it leaves the ancestor's box instead,
  which looks right until something is half-scrolled. A transform on the view
  does not reach it either: a window cannot be rotated.
- **The Windows choreographer is a 16ms timer**, not a display link. Doing it
  properly means `DwmGetCompositionTimingInfo` and `DwmFlush` on a thread of its
  own, because `DwmFlush` blocks and a blocked UI thread is worse than a
  slightly wrong interval. The same gap already recorded for worklets and
  Reanimated on both other desktops.
- ~~**Text colour is per-paragraph, not per-run.**~~ Phase 47. DirectWrite
  carries colour as a drawing effect rather than as a range attribute, which
  looks like it needs a custom `IDWriteTextRenderer` -- but Direct2D's own
  renderer has exactly one special case, and a drawing effect that is an
  `ID2D1Brush` is it.
- ~~**No `react-native run-windows`.**~~ Phase 47, and `run-macos` with it. All
  three are one function in `react-native-basalt/cli/desktop.js` with four
  strings passed in, which is the same split the C++ half makes.
- ~~**CI has no Windows runner.**~~ Added in phase 39, and small: the view layer
  builds with MSBuild and needs no display, no React Native and no bootstrap.
- ~~**No machine has run `scripts/compare_hosts.sh` with Windows in it.**~~ It
  has, once WSL2 worked: the GTK host built in Ubuntu 24.04 by
  `scripts/wsl_setup.sh`, beside the Windows host, and `compare_all.sh` says the
  two agree on all twelve apps. Getting there found two things, neither of them
  in a view layer. The distro had nothing registered for `https`, so Linux
  honestly failed a `canOpenURL` check a GitHub runner passes -- an environment
  gap, now covered by the setup script. And Windows failed a clipboard check in
  2 runs of 15, because a refused `OpenClipboard` silently dropped the write.
  It retries now, with a test that holds the clipboard from a window and fails
  without the retry; what was holding it was never caught, and 190 runs with
  logging on every refusal saw none.
- **`scripts/integration_test.py` skips Fast Refresh on Windows**, because
  `scripts/metro.sh` is a shell script. That reason has gone. A development run
  goes through `run-windows`, which starts Metro itself, and Fast Refresh works
  on Windows now -- an edit to a running Expo app reaches the tree. It did not
  before, for three separate reasons: the host read its Metro entry from an
  argument nothing passed, React Native's `start` command needs
  `@react-native/metro-config` in the app, and every host reported a dev script
  URL naming `linux`, so Metro sent Windows HMR updates for a Linux graph. The
  scenario should start Metro the way the run command does and stop skipping.
  The other four scenarios run.
- ~~**CI does not build the Windows host.**~~ It does, as `windows-full`:
  vcpkg, Hermes from source, React Native's core under clang-cl, every Windows
  test, the demo bundle and the end-to-end suite. Green on its first run, and
  51 minutes cold -- vcpkg 20, Hermes 13, the build 17. What that cost is
  what the caching around it is for: every cache is now saved by its own step
  as soon as it exists rather than when the whole job succeeds, the Windows
  build goes through ccache, and a change to `bootstrap.sh` no longer throws
  away Hermes. Pushes that touch only prose start no jobs at all.
- ~~**CI had been red for twenty-three commits.**~~ Fixed in phase 47, and worth
  keeping written down. The last green run was "Blob, File and FileReader"; the
  Linux job failed on every commit after it, including all nine Windows phases,
  and nobody looked. Both causes were invisible from a Windows desk -- a static
  archive cycle only GNU ld minds, and a header reaching `<cstdint>` through
  windows.h -- which is the argument for `scripts/check_includes.js` and for
  reading the log rather than the tick.

- **Nothing makes a red build hard to ignore.** No branch protection, no
  required check, no notification anyone reads. Thirteen commits of a silently
  failing Linux job is what that cost once, and none of the work above changes
  it.
