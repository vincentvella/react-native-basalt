# Upstream

Part of the [backlog](../BACKLOG.md). Not scheduled.

**Open (12):**

1. `http::Body::blob` is typed `std::optional<std::string>`
2. The cxx `NetworkingModule` does not mention blobs at all
3. `BaseViewConfig` registers `onPointerDown`, `onPointerUp` and `onPointerCancel` and does not declare them
4. `ReactInstanceConfig` has no `platform` field
5. GTK 4
6. React Native's npm package omits `ReactCxxPlatform`
7. The fetch needs a git tag matching the app's React Native
8. Also worth reporting, separately and smaller: the package ships ReactCommon/re
9. Report the HttpUtils
10. `ReactCommon/cmake-utils/react-native-flags.cmake` hardcodes clang's command line
11. Report that ReactCxxPlatform's PlatformConstantsModule hardcodes a React Nativ
12. Consider upstreaming a Linux entry in getHostPlatform

- **`http::Body::blob` is typed `std::optional<std::string>`** in
  ReactCxxPlatform, and `convertRequestBody` sends `{blobId, offset, size}` --
  an object. So a `Blob` request body throws "Value is an object, expected a
  String" in the bridging layer before reaching any platform's http client,
  identically on both desktops. The fix is a structured type or bridging that
  resolves the handle.
- **The cxx `NetworkingModule` does not mention blobs at all**, so
  `responseType: 'blob'` has no response path to hook and `addNetworkingHandler`
  has nothing to register with.

- **`BaseViewConfig` registers `onPointerDown`, `onPointerUp` and
  `onPointerCancel` and does not declare them.** All three are in
  `bubblingEventTypes` with their bubbled and captured names, and supported the
  whole way down -- `propsConversions.h` parses them into `ViewProps::events`,
  `PointerEventsProcessor` handles them, `TouchEventEmitter::onPointerDown`
  dispatches one. What is missing is their line in `validAttributes`, which
  lists the five hover-ish pointer props and stops. So React never sends the
  prop, the bit is never set, `shouldEmitPointerEvent` returns false, and the
  event is dropped in C++ -- silently, and only for the three left out.

  Costs a phone nothing, because a phone has no button to press. Costs a desktop
  the ability to answer a right-click at all, which is what found it. Worked
  around in `src/overrides/BaseViewConfig.js`, which is React Native's own file
  plus six keys and goes away when upstream adds them.

- **`ReactInstanceConfig` has no `platform` field.** `DevServerHelper` builds
  every bundle URL with `constexpr DEFAULT_PLATFORM = "android"`, so every
  desktop host asks Metro for an android bundle and the Metro plugin has to
  correct the request on arrival by reading the platform back out of `app=`.
  Worth a second upstream attempt now that
  two platforms need it rather than one.

- GTK 4.14's cairo renderer draws a transformed widget subtree unrotated and in
  the wrong colour; the GL renderer is correct. Worth reducing to a minimal case
  and reporting, or confirming it is already fixed in a later GTK.

- **React Native's npm package omits `ReactCxxPlatform`.** Worked around by
  fetching it at the app's exact version; see
  `docs/PORTING.md`. The upstream fix is one line and about
  1% of the package, and would remove the fetch entirely. Not raised: with no
  users to point at, the ask would sit. Worth revisiting when there are.
- The fetch needs a git tag matching the app's React Native. A nightly, a fork
  or an unreleased version has none, and there is no fallback.
- Also worth reporting, separately and smaller: the package ships
  `ReactCommon/react/nativemodule/cputime`'s C++ while its codegen spec lives
  under `src/private/testing/fantom` and does not ship, so that module cannot be
  compiled from the package. This platform stopped building it.
- Report the `HttpUtils.h` missing-`<cstdint>` bug. Since phase 41 there is a
  second of exactly the same shape and they should go together:
  `react/renderer/components/view/conversions.h` uses `M_PI` seven times, and
  `M_PI` is a POSIX extension rather than standard C++ -- MSVC's `<cmath>`
  defines it only behind `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`. Both compile on Meta's toolchains
  through luck rather than intent.
- **`ReactCommon/cmake-utils/react-native-flags.cmake` hardcodes clang's command
  line** -- `-Wall -Werror -fexceptions -frtti -std=c++20` -- and carries
  `TODO T228344694 improve this so that it works for all platforms` directly
  beneath. Worth attaching a concrete report to: MSVC's front end has none of
  those spellings, `-Wall` is actively misread by clang-cl as `/Wall` (which it
  maps to `-Weverything`), and because `-Wpedantic` is applied `INTERFACE` on
  `callinvoker` and `react_cxxstableapi` there is no flag a consumer can add
  that lands late enough to counteract it. Phase 41 works around it by stripping
  the flags from every target after `add_subdirectory`.
- Report that `ReactCxxPlatform`'s `PlatformConstantsModule` hardcodes a React
  Native version of 1000.0.0 in every version, releases included, so nothing
  built on it can ever satisfy React Native's own development-mode version
  check. Worked around in `src/LinuxPlatformConstants.cpp`.
- Consider upstreaming a Linux entry in `getHostPlatform.js` if the host build
  ever becomes something Meta would take.
