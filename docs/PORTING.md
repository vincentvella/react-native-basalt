# Porting notes

What it takes to build React Native's C++ core somewhere it was not built
before, and the handful of upstream facts that the build scripts depend on.

This is the file `native/bootstrap.sh`, `scripts/react-native.pin` and
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` point at. Everything here was arrived at by building
rather than by reading, and each section says what breaks if you do not do it.

## Building against an installed React Native

`ReactCxxPlatform` is not in the npm package.
`packages/react-native/package.json` lists `ReactCommon`, `ReactAndroid` and
`ReactApple` under `files`, and not `ReactCxxPlatform` — so an installed React
Native does not carry the layer an out-of-tree C++ platform is built on, and
`react-native run-linux --build` used to need a source checkout. Every app has
an installed React Native and almost none has a checkout.

**The upstream fix is one line**, adding `"ReactCxxPlatform"` to that `files`
array. It costs about 1% of the package. Nothing in the existing issues and pull
requests mentioning `ReactCxxPlatform` raises the packaging question, and
nothing has been opened from here: a one-line packaging change with one obscure
consumer is easy to ignore, and this platform has no users yet to point at.

**The workaround is to fetch the directory, not to vendor it.** When React
Native is an installed package with no `ReactCxxPlatform`, bootstrap does a
sparse, blobless clone of that one directory at the tag matching the app's exact
version — about 3MB and four seconds, a smaller bargain than the folly and
Hermes downloads it already makes.

Fetching is forced rather than preferred. Carrying a copy in this package was
the obvious answer and cannot work: that layer tracks `ReactCommon` closely, and
`main`'s copy fails against 0.87.1 on a ResizeObserver header that did not exist
and a `ReactInstance::createJSCallInvoker` that had not been added. One copy
cannot serve several React Natives, and a vendored copy would pin this package
to a single version the way react-native-windows pins to one exact nightly.
Fetching at the app's own version keeps the C++ and the JavaScript in step by
construction.

**A second, smaller gap**, which the build found and a path check did not:
`ReactCommon/react/nativemodule/cputime` ships its C++ but not its codegen spec,
which lives under `src/private/testing/fantom/specs/` and is reasonably
excluded. The package therefore contains C++ that cannot be compiled from the
package, and the failure reads as a missing `NativeCPUTimeCxxSpec` template —
like a codegen bug rather than a packaging one. Nothing links that target, so
this platform does not build it.

## Which React Natives are supported

`supported-versions.json` names, for each supported React Native, the Hermes to
build. Bootstrap reads it before downloading or compiling anything and refuses
an unsupported version in seconds, with a message saying what is supported and
where to look.

Today that is React Native 0.87.x, verified against 0.87.1, and `main` for
development.

A pinned triple rather than following the app, because following the app meant
every combination was its own experiment. Adding a version is now a deliberate
act: build against it, run both suites, add an entry. It cannot be done by
widening a range, and that is the point — 0.83 through 0.86 were once described
as "expected to work", which was a prediction wearing the clothes of support.
They are listed as untested and refused.

`ReactCxxPlatform` still comes from the app's exact version rather than from the
table, and that is not an inconsistency: the table bounds *which* minors are
supported, and the fetch keeps the C++ and the JavaScript exact *within* one.

## Hermes on Windows

Windows is listed among the platforms Meta publishes a prebuilt Hermes for, and
the prebuilt does not exist. So Windows builds Hermes from source, which needs
three things — one of them an upstream bug.

**`HERMES_ALLOW_BOOST_CONTEXT=0`.** Hermes' vendored `boost::context` throws
`std::bad_alloc` from its *Windows* stack allocator, and Hermes compiles with
exceptions off. The POSIX allocator does not, which is why this is Windows-only.
This is Hermes' own option for exactly that case — the one its ASAN and
Emscripten builds use — and the whole path is behind `#if
HERMES_USE_BOOST_CONTEXT`, so it is a clean fallback rather than a hole.

**`HERMES_EMPTY_BASES` on `VM::Environment`.** Static Hermes asserts that the
C++ `Environment` and the C `SHEnvironment` are layout-identical. `sizeof`
matches and the offsets do not, because `Environment` multiply-inherits from
`VariableSizeRuntimeCell` and an *empty* base, `llvh::TrailingObjects`, and the
MSVC ABI does not collapse empty bases the way the Itanium ABI does.

The fix is one word and Hermes already has it. `Support/Compiler.h` defines

    #define HERMES_EMPTY_BASES __declspec(empty_bases)

with a comment saying it is necessary for `PointerBase` alignment under
`HERMESVM_CONTIGUOUS_HEAP`, which is the mode this builds in — and the macro is
applied to nothing at all in the entire tree. Dead code that was presumably
attached to something once. Applying it to `Environment` clears the assertion.

**Exceptions, for React Native's jsi.** A POSIX assumption hiding inside a
difference between two compilers' defaults, and the most interesting of the
three.

`jsi.cpp` throws `JSError`. Hermes' `cmake/modules/Hermes.cmake` strips `/EHsc`
out of `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` wholesale to avoid a D9025 warning, then puts `/EHsc`
or `/EHs-c-` back on each of *its own* targets through
`hermes_update_compile_flags()`. React Native's `jsi` is not one of its own
targets: it arrives through `JSI_DIR`, never goes through that helper, and so
ends up with **no `/EH` flag at all**, CMake's default having been removed on
its behalf. clang with no flag defaults exceptions *on*; clang-cl with no flag
defaults them *off*. The strip is safe on every platform Hermes is tested on and
fatal on this one.

`HERMES_ENABLE_EH=ON` is the supported knob for Hermes' own targets, and it has
to be `HERMES_ENABLE_RTTI=ON` alongside it — `API/hermes/CMakeLists.txt` refuses
the mixed case outright. Worth knowing because the failure arrives as a
configure error about ICU much further down the log, which is collateral and
sends you looking in the wrong place.

For the jsi target the flag has to come from `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` instead, spelled
`/EHs /EHc` — exactly equivalent, and not the literal string their `REPLACE`
looks for.

One trap, recorded because it cost a full rebuild: `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=...`
**replaces** CMake's platform defaults rather than adding to them, and those
defaults are where `/DWIN32 /D_WINDOWS` come from. Hermes' `OSCompat.h` keys its
`<unistd.h>` include on `_WINDOWS`, so overriding the variable makes a Windows
build start looking for POSIX headers. Pass the defaults back with it.

## clang-cl rather than cl

The two front ends fail differently on Hermes, and the difference decided the
toolchain for the whole core build:

- **cl** stops at 260 of 415 on `__builtin_expect` in Static Hermes'
  `static_h.h` — a GCC and Clang builtin MSVC does not have, and not something a
  flag can supply.
- **clang-cl** has that builtin and gets past it, which is what makes the three
  fixes above sufficient rather than the first of a long list.

`docs/DECISIONS.md` also prefers clang wherever there is a choice, for
independent reasons.

## Upstream portability bugs this build works around

Both are the same shape — a POSIX assumption in a header — and both are fixed
from the command line rather than by editing React Native's tree:

- **`M_PI`** is used seven times in
  `react/renderer/components/view/conversions.h`, to convert degrees for
  `transform: rotate`. It is a POSIX extension rather than standard C++, and
  MSVC's `<cmath>` defines it only behind `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`.
- **A missing `<cstdint>`** in `HttpUtils.h`, which this build force-includes
  around.

`docs/backlog/upstream.md` carries these and the rest.
