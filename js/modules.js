/**
 * A React Native app that imports and uses the core modules this platform was
 * missing.
 *
 * The imports alone are half the test. `Clipboard` and `Vibration` are looked
 * up with `getEnforcing`, so before phase 32 the two lines at the top of this
 * file took the whole app down before anything rendered -- no error boundary,
 * no first paint, just a dead window. The rest were looked up with `get`, which
 * returns null, so they were worse to debug: `Alert.alert()` was a dialog that
 * never appeared and `Linking.openURL()` a link that never opened, both
 * silently.
 *
 * Results are logged and rendered as a row of boxes, one per check that passed,
 * so the tree says how many without needing a text engine.
 *
 * Nothing here shows a dialog: `Alert.alert` is modal, and a test that stopped
 * for a human would never finish. That one is exercised by hand -- see
 * plan/32-core-modules.md.
