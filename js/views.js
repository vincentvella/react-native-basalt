/**
 * A real React Native app made only of `<View>`.
 *
 * This exists to test the JavaScript platform layer without needing the view
 * layer to be finished. It imports `react-native` properly, goes through
 * `AppRegistry`, renders with React and lays out with Yoga -- so every one of
 * the overrides in `packages/react-native-linux/metro-config.js` has to work
 * for it to run at all. What it deliberately avoids is `<Text>`, `<Image>`,
 * `<ScrollView>` and `<TextInput>`, none of which macOS can mount yet.
 *
 * The layout is nested flex on purpose. A flat row would produce a tree that
 * agrees between two platforms by accident; this one only agrees if Yoga ran
 * on identical input and the mutations arrived in the same order.
 *
 * Nothing here branches on the platform, because `scripts/compare_hosts.sh`
 * diffs the two trees and a difference must mean a bug rather than a choice.
 * `Platform.OS` is logged instead, which is how the same script checks that
 * each host got the platform it asked for.
 *
