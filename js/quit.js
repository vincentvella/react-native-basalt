/**
 * An app that would rather not be quit just yet.
 *
 * `useCloseRequest()` guards a window; this guards the application, which is
 * a different event with a different route through every desktop -- macOS
 * asks `applicationShouldTerminate:` and asks no window, and a session ending
 * on Linux or Windows does the same. An app with unsaved work that guarded
 * only its windows would lose it to Cmd-Q.
 *
 * The screen reports what happened, so a scenario can read it: how many quits
 * were refused, and whether the app has since agreed to one. Agreeing ends
 * the process, so the tree that proves it is the tree written on the way out.
