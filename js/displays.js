/**
 * An app about the screens it is on.
 *
 * React Native has no API for this: on a phone there is one display, it is
 * the screen, and `Dimensions` is the answer. On a desktop it is a question
 * with a list for an answer, and the list changes while the app is running.
 *
 * Every number on screen is asserted by the scenario, so the layout is fixed
 * heights: what matters is that a display exists, that its scale factor is
 * sane, and that the work area is inside the bounds rather than outside them.
