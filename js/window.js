/**
 * A React Native app about the window it is in.
 *
 * React Native has no API for this: on a phone there is one window, it is the
 * screen, and nothing an app says would change it. So, like js/dialogs.js, this
 * is a screen about something React Native does not do at all.
 *
 * Its own bounds are on screen and logged, which is the half worth asserting:
 * `bounds` is live, so a window resized by anything -- the person, the window
 * manager, or the buttons here -- re-renders the app with the new numbers. An
 * app that cached `getBounds()` would be right until somebody dragged a corner.
 *
 * A second app below is about how big the window may be, which is a different
 * question and not the same on every desktop -- so it starts by logging what
 * this one says it can do.

 * What is worth watching is that the window does not go there: a size is a
 * request, and a limit is what the window manager answers it with.
 *
 * Its own screen rather than more buttons on the one above, because the app
 * above asks for sizes and this one constrains them, and a screen that did both
 * would have two answers to "how big is it".
 *
 * `capabilities` is logged first because two of these do nothing on Linux and
 * that is settled rather than pending -- GTK4 removed both calls, because
 * Wayland has no protocol for either. An app reads this instead of reading a
 * platform check.
