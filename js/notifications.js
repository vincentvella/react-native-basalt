/**
 * A React Native app that asks `expo-notifications` for a notification.
 *
 * React Native has no notification API to port -- `PushNotificationIOS` is a
 * separate package and Android's is a library -- so the contract worth
 * implementing is the one an app is most likely already using. That is the same
 * argument react-native-gesture-handler was ported on, and expo-clipboard
 * before it: the package's JavaScript is unchanged, and what this platform
 * supplies is the native modules underneath it.
 *
 * What each desktop can actually do differs, and the API already has a way to
 * say so -- which is why the first thing this checks is the permission, exactly
 * as expo's own documentation tells an app to. Linux can show one through
 * `org.freedesktop.Notifications` and reports `granted`; macOS and Windows
 * report `denied` with a reason, because both need the host to be an installed,
 * bundled application and it is not one yet. See native/core/Notifications.h.
 *
 * Every step is logged, which is what the end-to-end suite reads.
 *
