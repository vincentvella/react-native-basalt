/**
 * A React Native app with more than one window.
 *
 * A second window is a second surface and so a second React tree, which is
 * Fabric's grain rather than a decision this made: a surface is what has a
 * size, a layout context and a root shadow node. So the interesting thing to
 * watch is not that a window opens -- it is that the two trees stay in step.
 *
 * The counter lives in the first window's state. The second window renders it,
 * and its button calls back into the first window's setter. Both windows show
 * the same number because there is only one, and it crosses as a prop and a
 * closure rather than through context, which is exactly the boundary
 * `<Window>`'s header describes.
 *
 * Two more apps below cover being *asked* before a window closes, which is the
 * other half: `<Window onCloseRequest>` and `useCloseRequest()`. They are
 * separate registrations rather than more buttons on this one because each has
 * to have a single stable answer -- a screen that both refuses and allows is a
 * screen whose state depends on when you look.
