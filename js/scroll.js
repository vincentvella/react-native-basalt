/**
 * A React Native app built around `<ScrollView>`.
 *
 * A ScrollView is not one feature but four that have to agree: Yoga letting the
 * content exceed the viewport, the platform clipping it, the offset moving
 * children *and* being written back into ScrollViewState, and `onScroll`
 * reaching JavaScript. Three of those are invisible from a screenshot, so the
 * row index is rendered as a width -- each row is as wide as its number -- and
 * the scroll position is reported through onScroll and logged.
 *
 * It also scrolls itself, once, through `scrollTo` on a ref. That is the
 * imperative command path, which is a separate seam from the wheel -- it
 * arrives on the JS thread and has to be marshalled -- and it is the only way
 * to scroll both hosts identically from one file, since a wheel has to be
 * injected per platform.
 *
 * No <Text>, so the same file runs on a platform with no text engine, and no
 * VirtualizedList, so a failure here is this project's rather than React
 * Native's.
