/**
 * A React Native app whose whole job is to call `Share.share()`.
 *
 * Worth an app of its own because the interesting part is not visible in a view
 * tree: what `Share` does on this platform is decided in three places at once,
 * and until phase 55 the first of them stopped the other two ever running.
 * React Native's `Share.js` branches on `Platform.OS` being exactly `android`
 * or `ios` and rejects with "Unsupported platform" otherwise, so no desktop
 * module was ever reached. The replacement is in
 * packages/react-native-basalt/src/overrides/Share.js.
 *
 * Underneath, macOS shows `NSSharingServicePicker` and the other two show a
 * small picker built from a clipboard and a mail client, because Linux has no
 * share service at all. Either way the promise settles the same three ways, and
 * that is what this logs.
 *
 * The sheet is modal and an automated run has nobody to dismiss it, so the
 * default is to check everything up to the point of opening one:
 * that the module is there, that the invariants still hold, and that a call
 * with neither a message nor a URL is refused. Pass BASALT_SHARE_OPEN=1 to
 * actually open it and watch what the promise does.
