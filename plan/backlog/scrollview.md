# ScrollView

Part of the [backlog](../backlog.md). Not scheduled.

**Open (5):**

1. Trackpad (pixel-unit) scrolling is unverified; the wheel path is, on X11
2. No snapping, paging or maintainVisibleContentPosition
3. No scrollbars are drawn
4. contentBoundingRect
5. disableViewCulling is never set, which will matter once AT-SPI lands

- Trackpad (pixel-unit) scrolling is unverified; the wheel path is, on X11.
- ~~No momentum.~~ See the Input section. What is left is Windows, which has no
  fling velocity to model one from, and `onScrollEndDrag`'s velocity, which is
  still reported as zero on every host -- so `ScrollView._isAnimating()` is
  still wrong.
- ~~**`animated: true` scrolls instantly.**~~ Done on all three:
  `core/ScrollAnimation.h` is a cubic ease-in-out over a fixed duration, which a
  fling deliberately is not -- a fling has velocity and no target, this has a
  target and no velocity, and exponential friction approaches a destination
  without ever arriving at it.

  Each host steps it with what it already has: GTK a frame-clock tick callback
  beside the fling's, AppKit a `CADisplayLink` per animating view because the
  system does its own deceleration and there was no stepper to borrow, Windows a
  thread timer because the scroll manager has a tag rather than an HWND. A
  gesture or a wheel cancels it on all three -- the person moving the list wins
  over the app moving it.
- No snapping, paging or `maintainVisibleContentPosition`.
- No scrollbars are drawn.
- `contentBoundingRect.origin` is assumed to be zero; iOS positions its
  container view at that origin.
- `disableViewCulling` is never set, which will matter once AT-SPI lands.
