- Nothing evicts the texture cache. A long-lived app that scrolls through many
  remote images grows without bound.
- `resizeMode: 'repeat'` falls back to `center`; a repeating draw needs a
  pattern node rather than one texture append.
- `blurRadius`, `tintColor`, `overlayColor`, `fadeDuration` and
  `progressiveRenderingEnabled` are ignored.
- ~~A `require()`d image drew nothing.~~ It laid out at the right size and had
  no pixels, and the reason was neither the loader nor the mounting manager:
  Metro's `build` command has no `--assets-dest`, so the files were never copied
  next to the bundle. `scripts/copy_assets.js` reads the asset descriptors back
  out of the bundle Metro just wrote and copies each one to where
  `AssetSourceResolver.scaledAssetURLNearBundle` will look for it -- including
  that rule's own escaping, where each `../` becomes a single `_`. The demo's
  images never showed this because they are `{uri: ...}` rather than requires.
- Assets are never fetched over the network, so a dev server's assets do not
  work; `downloadAsync` rejects saying so. The host has an http client already.
- Nothing caches a downloaded asset, which is right for a local file and will
  not be for a remote one.
- `onProgress` and `onPartialLoad` are never emitted.
- `IImageLoader` itself is still unimplemented, so `Image.getSize` and
  `Image.prefetch` do nothing. That is a separate seam from the rendering path.
