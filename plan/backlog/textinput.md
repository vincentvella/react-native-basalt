# TextInput

Part of the [backlog](../backlog.md). Not scheduled.

- ~~**An uncontrolled field loses what was typed into it.**~~ Found on Windows
  in phase 46 and fixed on all three in phase 47. React Native's `TextInput.js`
  sends `text={value ?? defaultValue}`, so an uncontrolled field with no default
  sends `undefined` -- the empty string by the time it is C++, indistinguishable
  from a controlled field that was just cleared -- and it re-sends
  `mostRecentEventCount` on every change, which is an Update mutation on its
  own. Applying the prop whenever it differed from the widget therefore wiped
  the field on the user's second keystroke. It is now applied when the *prop*
  changes, because a controlled field's value changes as the user types and an
  uncontrolled one's never does, and a prop older than the last keystroke is
  dropped without being forgotten. Nobody had noticed because `js/input.js`
  asserts on its *controlled* field.
  - Still worth doing properly one day: iOS reads the shadow **state** rather
    than the prop, and writes the typed text into that state, so applying it
    back is a no-op and no heuristic is needed. That means a platform writing
    `TextInputState`, which none of these three do.
- No `multiline`. `RCTMultilineTextInputView` is not registered, and the C++
  side would need a `GtkTextView` peer rather than a `GtkText`.
- `onKeyPress` and `onSelectionChange` are never emitted. Both are cheap -- a
  `GtkEventControllerKey` and GtkText's `notify::cursor-position` -- and both
  were left out to keep the first version small.
- No `selection` prop, so a controlled selection is impossible.
- No shared focus registry: `TextInput.State.currentlyFocusedInput()` does not
  exist, and nothing else can ask what has focus. React Native's own
  `TextInputState` module talks to a TurboModule this platform does not have.
- `blur` grabs focus for the window rather than dropping it, because GTK models
  focus as moving, not as absent. The `onBlur` event is still correct.
- `placeholderTextColor`, `selectionColor` and `cursorColor` are parsed and
  ignored. GtkText takes those from CSS, not from a `PangoAttrList`, and this
  platform has no per-widget CSS provider.
- `src/overrides/TextInput.js` is a fork of React Native's component, and the only fork
  in the tree. Every prop upstream adds is a prop it will not have.
- `autoCapitalize`, `autoCorrect`, `spellCheck`, `keyboardType`,
  `returnKeyType`, `clearButtonMode`, `selectTextOnFocus` and
  `clearTextOnFocus` are ignored.
