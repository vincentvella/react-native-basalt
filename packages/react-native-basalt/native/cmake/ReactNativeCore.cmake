# ReactCommon/cmake-utils/react-native-flags.cmake puts this on every target it
# touches:
#
#     -Wall -Werror -fexceptions -frtti -std=c++20
#
# and immediately below it says `TODO T228344694 improve this so that it works
# for all platforms`, which is this problem, acknowledged upstream and not yet
# fixed. Three of those five are clang command-line spellings that MSVC's front
# end does not have, and `-std=c++20` is actively harmful: clang-cl discards it
# with a warning, and cl would take it as a filename.
#
# Patching the checkout is not an option -- nothing here modifies React Native,
# which is the property that lets this platform track it. Removing the flags
# from each target afterwards was tried and does not work either: React Native
# applies them PUBLIC, so every copy also lives in the INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
# of everything a target links, and they come back on the command line *after*
# the ones taken off. Chasing them through the link graph would be a fight with
# the build system on every upstream bump.
#
# So the flags are left alone and clang-cl is told not to treat its own
# "I ignored this" as an error. That is the honest reading of the situation:
# clang-cl is right to ignore them, and nothing is lost by it. `-std=c++20` is
# already supplied as `/std:c++20` from CXX_STANDARD, and exceptions and RTTI
# are added below in MSVC's spelling -- so all three are in force, just spelled
# the other way. `-Wall -Werror` are understood by clang-cl and kept, because
# building React Native's C++ warning-free is what catches an upstream change
# early.
#
# This is also why the core build needs clang-cl rather than cl. cl does not
# understand `-Werror` or clang's `-Wall` at all, and its own `/Wall` is a
# different and far noisier set; the Windows *view layer* builds fine with
# either, and CI uses cl for it.

# --- The Windows flags, applied to everything React Native added -------------
#
# `-Wno-unknown-argument` and `-Wno-everything` have to land *after* React
# Native's own `-Wall -Werror -fexceptions -frtti -std=c++20`, and a compiler
# command line is built in a fixed order: CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, then the directory's
# options, then the target's, then those a linked target exports. Only the last
# two are after React Native's, and React Native applies its flags to every
# target it defines -- ReactCxxPlatform's as much as ReactCommon's.
#
# So this walks every target in the build graph rather than a list. A list was
# tried first and covered ReactCommon but not ReactCxxPlatform, which failed
# seventy-three translation units later on -Wlanguage-extension-token inside
# folly's F14Table.h -- the same -Weverything, arriving by a route the list did
# not know about. Walking is the version that does not need updating when
# upstream adds a directory.
# Counteracting the flags was tried before removing them, and cannot work.
# `-Wno-everything` does undo `-Wall`, but React Native also applies
# `-Wpedantic`, and applies it INTERFACE on callinvoker and react_cxxstableapi
# -- so it arrives from the link graph, after every PRIVATE option, and
# re-enables -Wlanguage-extension-token on top of whatever came before. There
# is no flag that reliably lands last. Removing is the only order-independent
# answer.
#
# Both property sets, because INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS is how the ones that
# arrive last get there in the first place.
