#
# Two ways of finding the same four libraries, and the split is Windows.
#
# On Linux and macOS they come from the system -- apt or Homebrew -- and
# `find_library` is the right tool, because a distro's package installs a bare
# `libglog.so` in a directory the linker already searches. On Windows there is
# no system to install them into. vcpkg is the equivalent, and it ships proper
# CMake config packages, which is a better answer than `find_library` even
# where both would work: a config package carries the include directories, the
# transitive dependencies and the debug/release split, and a bare
# `find_library` on `boost_regex` would not even match the name vcpkg gives it
# (`boost_regex-vc143-mt-x64-1_89.lib`).
#
# The target names below -- `glog`, `boost`, `double-conversion`, `fmt` -- are
# not ours to choose either way. They are what React Native's own CMakeLists
# link against.

#
# First, the name found above is wrong here. Hermes' `hermesvm` target builds a
# DLL, and a Windows DLL exports nothing without __declspec(dllexport), which
# Hermes does not annotate -- so `hermesvm.lib` is a one-kilobyte import library
# for a DLL with nothing in it, next to a thirty-megabyte `hermesvm_a.lib` that
# has the engine. On Linux the shared object works because ELF exports
# everything by default; that default is the only reason the name is right
# there.
#
# Second, jsi has to be named separately. `-DJSI_DIR` makes the Hermes build
# compile React Native's jsi, and on Linux libhermesvm.so absorbs it the way a
# shared library absorbs its static dependencies. A static archive absorbs
# nothing, so on Windows jsi.lib is a second file and the link fails on
# jsi::Value and jsi::JSError without it.

  # and defines USE_WIN10_ICU, which means it calls u_strToUpper, ucol_strcoll
  # and friends out of the operating system's own icu.dll rather than vendoring
  # a copy. `icu.lib` is that DLL's import library and ships with the Windows

# React Native, and defining the other costs nothing.
# GLOBAL because the platform packages are separate directories now: an
# imported target is visible only in the directory that created it and below,
# and react-native-basalt-gtk adds this one as a *sibling* subdirectory rather
