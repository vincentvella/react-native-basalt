# react-native-worklets, compiled from the app's own copy.
#
# The same arrangement as Expo.cmake and for the same reason: the package ships
# its portable half as C++ in `Common/cpp`, depending on jsi, Hermes, a call
# invoker and nothing else, so the app's own copy compiles at the app's own
# version. Nothing is vendored and nothing is pinned.
#
# What the package does *not* ship for a desktop is the host half -- the
# TurboModule, the UI scheduler, the frame queue and the platform logger are
# written per platform, and iOS's and Android's are a few hundred lines each.
# Those are core/Worklets*.{h,cpp} here.
#
# Reanimated sits on top of this and is the same shape again; see
# plan/38-reanimated.md.
