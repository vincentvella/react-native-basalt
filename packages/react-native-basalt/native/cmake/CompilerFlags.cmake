# The same intentions, spelled for two compiler front ends.
#
# Everything in this build was written for clang's command line, because until
# Windows there were only clang targets: `plan/decisions.md` records why the
# project is a clang codebase rather than a GCC one, and both desktops it had
# were clang. MSVC's front end takes none of those spellings, and clang-cl takes
# MSVC's rather than clang's -- it is the same compiler behind a different
# command line, which is exactly the trap: `-frtti` on clang-cl is silently
# interpreted as an input filename, not as a request for RTTI.
#
# So each flag this build actually depends on is named here once, and the two
# spellings sit side by side where a reader can check they mean the same thing.
# The alternative -- `if(MSVC)` scattered through ThirdParty.cmake and
# ReactNativeCore.cmake -- would put the two halves of each decision in
# different files.
#
# Note the guard is `MSVC`, not the compiler id: CMake sets MSVC for clang-cl
# too, which is what we want, because the command line is what differs.
