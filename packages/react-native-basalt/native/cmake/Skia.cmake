# @shopify/react-native-skia, compiled from the app's own copy.
#
# The same arrangement as Worklets.cmake and for the same reason: the package
# ships its portable half as C++ over JSI, so the app's copy compiles at the
# app's version and nothing is vendored or pinned. What it does not ship for a
# desktop is the host half -- and here that half is unusually small, because the
# package's own division of labour happens to suit us.
#
# ## What is borrowed and what is replaced
#
# Of the fourteen Objective-C++ sources in `apple/`, seven touch React Native and
# seven do not, and the seven that do are precisely the ones a host would write
# anyway:
#
#   borrowed   MetalContext, MetalWindowContext, MetalLayerColorSpace,
#              SkiaCVPixelBufferUtils, RNSkAppleVideo, RNSkAppleView,
#              RNSkMetalCanvasProvider
#   replaced   RNSkiaModule and SkiaManager (the TurboModule),
#              RNSkApplePlatformContext (its *header* takes an RCTBridge and
#              builds a screenshot service from bridge.uiManager, so it cannot be
#              used as-is even though its .mm touches React in one place),
#              ViewScreenshotService, SkiaUIView, SkiaPictureView,
#              SkiaPictureViewManager
#
# MetalContext is the reason this is small. It is React-free and already offers
# MakeOffscreen, MakeImageFromBuffer, getDirectContext and -- for later --
# MakeWindow(CALayer *), which takes a layer rather than a React view. So a
# `<Canvas>` needs to hand over its own layer and nothing more.
#
# ## macOS only, for now
#
# Skia's binaries are per platform and the ones published are Apple's. Linux and
# Windows need Skia built from source; the package has scripts/build-skia.ts for
# exactly that, and android/CMakeLists.txt is a complete non-Apple CMake build of
# these same sources to follow. Neither is done here.
