// react-native-gesture-handler's recognisers, on the desktop.
//
// RNGH is not an Expo module and has no portable C++ to compile: it ships
// Objective-C for Apple, Kotlin for Android, and a TypeScript engine for the
// web. What is portable is its *contract*, which is small and well defined --
// eight module methods, a six-value state machine, and two device events -- and
// that contract is what this file implements.
//
// The division is the same one the rest of this project uses. Everything here
// is platform-independent: a handler is a state machine fed with a pointer
// position and a list of the views under it, and what it produces is a payload
// to hand to JavaScript. The toolkits contribute two things and no more --
// where the pointer is, and which views are under it -- which is exactly what
// each one's touch dispatcher already works out for React Native's own touches.
//
// ## What a handler is
//
// `createGestureHandler('PanGestureHandler', 7, config)` makes one.
// `attachGestureHandler(7, viewTag)` says which view it watches. From then on
// every pointer event that lands on that view, or anything inside it, is
// offered to the handler, and the handler decides whether this is the gesture
// it is looking for.
//
// The states are RNGH's, and the order matters to its JavaScript:
// UNDETERMINED -> BEGAN when a pointer lands, BEGAN -> ACTIVE when the
// recogniser is satisfied, ACTIVE -> END when the pointer lifts. FAILED and
// CANCELLED are the two ways out.
//
// ## What is recognised, and what is not
//
// Tap, long press, pan, fling, native and manual. Pinch, rotation and force
// touch are created and never activate, because they need a second finger or a
// pressure reading that a mouse does not have; saying so here is better than a
// handler that looks attached and quietly never fires.
//
// One pointer. A desktop has one cursor, so `numberOfPointers` is always 1 and
// a gesture configured to need two never activates.
//
// ## Conflicts
//
// When a handler activates it cancels every other handler tracking the same
// pointer, unless the two were declared simultaneous. `waitFor` holds a handler
// at BEGAN until the handler it waits for has failed. That is the useful half
// of RNGH's conflict resolution; what is missing is documented in
// plan/37-gesture-handler.md.
