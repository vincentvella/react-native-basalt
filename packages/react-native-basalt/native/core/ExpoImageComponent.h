// expo-image's view, as a Fabric component.
//
// An Expo module's *functions* are an object in `globalThis.expo.modules`; see
// core/ExpoModules.h. An Expo module's *views* are not. `requireNativeViewManager`
// asks `globalThis.expo.getViewConfig(moduleName)` for a static view config and
// registers an ordinary React Native component called
// `ViewManagerAdapter_<moduleName>` with it. From that point on it is a Fabric
// component like any other: a name, a props class, a shadow node, a descriptor
// in the registry, and a mounting peer on each platform.
//
// So this file is the second half of the Expo port, and the half that is not
// Expo-specific at all -- there is nothing here that expo-modules-core has to
// be present for, which is why it compiles unconditionally. What needs Expo is
// the view config, and that lives with the rest of the runtime.
//
// **The view config is the contract.** React Native filters props against
// `validAttributes` in JavaScript before they are ever diffed, so a prop absent
// from the config never reaches C++ -- silently. That is the same trap phase 26
// found with `shouldNotifyLoadEvents`, and here both sides are ours, so the
// list in ExpoRuntime and the parsing below have to be read together.
//
// What is supported is what this platform can draw: a source, a content fit, a
// tint. expo-image's placeholder, transition, blurhash, cache policy and SF
// Symbols are left out of the view config, so they are dropped in JavaScript
// and never travel. An app using them gets an image without them rather than an
// error, which is the honest outcome for a prop whose effect is decorative.
// See plan/36-expo-image.md.
