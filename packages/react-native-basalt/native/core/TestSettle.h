// Quitting when there is nothing left to wait for, rather than on a guess.
//
// `BASALT_QUIT_AFTER_MS` is a budget chosen before the process starts, and it
// has to be long enough for the slowest machine that will ever run it. So every
// scenario waits out the worst case on every machine: `Image.getSize` asks for
// three seconds and takes 3.7 of them, of which about 0.7 is real work.
//
// Two problems, and the smaller one is the time. The larger is that every such
// budget is a latent flake -- "should be long enough" is a guess that a loaded
// CI machine eventually falsifies, and when it does the scenario fails for a
// reason that has nothing to do with what it tests. One of those is already in
// docs/backlog/testing.md.
//
// `BASALT_QUIT_WHEN_SETTLED=<ms>` replaces the guess with a fact. The host quits
// <ms> after it has settled, where settled means:
//
//   - the first mount has been applied -- React produced a tree and the host
//     put it on screen. Recorded in MountingWalk::applyMutations, which is the
//     one place all three hosts mount through, so this is one code site rather
//     than three.
//   - any scripted input has been delivered. Each host schedules its own and
//     knows the total, and says so through noteScriptedInputEndsInMs.
//
// `BASALT_QUIT_AFTER_MS` stays as the backstop, so nothing gets *slower* and a
// host that never settles still ends. The two are complementary: one is the
// ceiling, this is the actual duration.
//
// The <ms> is a settle rather than a deadline, and it is small -- a few hundred
// milliseconds for React's next commit and the frame that draws it. It is still
// a guess, but it is a guess about one round trip instead of about a whole
// scenario, and quitting too early fails loudly: every scenario that opts in
// asserts on the dumped tree, so a tree that is not there yet is a failure and
// not a false pass. That direction is the whole reason this is safe to do.
