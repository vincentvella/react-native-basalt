// Answering a modal dialog without showing one.
//
// The same escape hatch `BASALT_TEST_TAP` is, for the same reason and with the
// same limits. A modal dialog is the one piece of interface an automated run
// cannot get past: there is nobody to press a button, the window system will
// not synthesise a press into a sheet, and on macOS a sheet that is up stops
// `[NSApp terminate:]` outright -- so a run that shows one hangs until it is
// killed.
//
// ## Why not drive the real dialog
//
// Because that is where the flakiness lives, and the platforms say so
// themselves. Apple's own mechanism for this in UI tests,
// `addUIInterruptionMonitor`, is documented as not firing on recent iOS
// versions, and the workaround people reach for -- pressing the button through
// SpringBoard -- is widely reported as flaky; Apple's own advice for permission
// dialogs is to pre-grant them through launch arguments rather than to press
// anything. Detox, which is the closest thing React Native has to a house
// end-to-end runner, states the principle outright: gray box rather than black
// box, monitor the app from the inside, because that is what fights flakiness
// at the core.
//
// Driving it from outside is also not available here. AT-SPI on Linux, the
// Accessibility API on macOS and UI Automation on Windows can each press a
// button in a dialog, and each needs a permission or a session an automated run
// does not have -- which is the same wall `BASALT_TEST_TAP` exists because of.
//
// ## What this skips, exactly
//
// The dialog's presentation and nothing else. The request is built by the same
// module from the same JavaScript, the answer travels back through the same
// callback on the same thread, and every line above the platform runs. What
// goes untested is that the toolkit can put a dialog on screen and get a press
// out of it, which is the same thing every other instrument in this project
// leaves to a person.
