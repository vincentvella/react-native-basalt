// What happened when this process asked Metro for its bundle.
//
// React Native's cxx `DevServerHelper` hands the response body straight to the
// JS engine without looking at the status code, and `ReactHost` treats any
// failure as "Metro is not running" and quietly loads the on-disk bundle
// instead. That is right for one of the two ways the fetch can fail and wrong
// for the other:
//
//   - Nothing is listening. curl reports a connection error, no body is
//     produced, and falling back to the prebuilt bundle is exactly what should
//     happen. Verified; see plan/33-dev-bundle-errors.md.
//   - Metro is running and answers 500, which is what it does for any error in
//     your app -- a syntax error, a missing import, a failing transform. The
//     body is Metro's JSON error report, and compiling it as JavaScript
//     produces `Compiling JS failed: 1:8:';' expected`, naming a line in
//     Metro's error rather than a line in your code.
//
// This file separates the two. `core/HttpClient.cpp` recognises the bundle
// request, and on a non-2xx status records the failure here and reports an
// error instead of a body -- so nothing tries to compile it. The host reads
// `devBundleError()` after `loadScript` returns and refuses to start on a
// server error, because the alternative is running yesterday's bundle while the
// developer stares at code that is not what is executing.

// For uint32_t, which nothing else here brings in. It compiled on Windows
