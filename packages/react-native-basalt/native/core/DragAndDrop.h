// Dragging something into the application, and out of it.
//
// A desktop application is expected to accept a file dropped on it. React
// Native has no API for that, because a phone has no pointer to drag with, so
// there is nothing here to be compatible with -- which makes the shape this
// takes a decision rather than a port.
//
// ## Marked by nativeID, like the title bar's drag regions
//
// A view says it accepts a drop by setting `nativeID`, the one prop a plain
// `<View>` carries to the host on every platform. The alternative is a
// registration call keyed on a tag from `findNodeHandle`, which means a
// module method, a ref, and a lifetime to get wrong -- for a fact about a
// view that React already sends down on every commit.
//
// See core/TitleBarRegions.h, which marks views the same way and for the same
// reason. The strings live here rather than in a host because every host that
// reads them must read the same ones, and JavaScript writes them from a
// fourth place.
//
// ## What a drop target accepts
//
// Files and text, which are the two kinds every desktop agrees on. The marker
// carries them so that a view accepting only files is not told about dragged
// text at all -- the desktop asks "will you take this?" before the drop, and
// answering honestly is what makes the cursor say no rather than the app
// rejecting it afterwards.
//
// ## Which view is told
//
// The deepest accepting view under the pointer, found by walking up from the
// view the hit test returned. Exactly the rule the title bar applies, and for
// the same reason: a label inside a drop target should not have to be marked,
// and a drop target inside another should win.
