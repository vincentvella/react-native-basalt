// `SourceCode`, which is how JavaScript learns where the bundle came from.
//
// It sounds like diagnostics and is not: React Native's asset resolution is
// built on it. `AssetSourceResolver` asks whether the script came from a server
// or from a file, and answers `require('./logo.png')` with either a URL on that
// server or a path beside that file. With no script URL, every asset resolves
// to nonsense -- `file://assets/assets/logo.png`, in the case that led here.
//
// ReactCxxPlatform ships a SourceCode module, and on React Native 0.86 it is
// always handed an empty string: `ReactHost` has no `sourceURL_` at all, and
// 0.87 added one. Rather than support this on the versions that happen to fill
// it in, the host reports the URL itself, which it has known all along.
