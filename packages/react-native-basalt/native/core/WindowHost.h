// Opening a second window.
//
// Fabric has supported more than one surface all along -- `startSurface` takes
// a surface id, the mounting managers keep a root per id, and the error
// inspector has been a second surface since it was written. What has been
// missing is a second *window* to put one in: every host made exactly one, at
// startup, and everything in it reached for `the` window and `the` root.
//
// So this is the seam for the part that is genuinely per-toolkit -- making a
// window and wiring a surface into it -- and `core/WindowsModule.h` is the
// JavaScript boundary above it. The implementation lives in each host's
// `main_*.cpp` rather than beside the other platform services, because that is
// where a window is made and where the ReactHost that starts a surface lives.
//
// ## A window is a surface
//
// One window, one surface, one React root. That is Fabric's grain rather than a
// simplification: a surface is what has a size, a layout context and a root
// shadow node, and two windows sharing one would be two windows sharing a
// layout. It is also why the id a window is identified by *is* its surface id
// -- there is no second numbering to keep in step.
//
// The cost is that a second window is a second React tree: it does not share
// context, state or a render pass with the first. `<Window>` in JavaScript
// papers over enough of that to be useful and says where it cannot; see
// src/Window.js.
