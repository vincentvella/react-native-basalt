// Not platform-specific, which is why it is here. A URI is a URI: `file://`,
// a bare path, `data:` and `http(s)` mean the same things on every desktop, and
// the only part of image loading that differs is decoding the bytes into
// whatever the toolkit paints -- a GdkTexture on GTK, a CGImage on AppKit.
//
// Written second, which is the useful part: this began as private code inside
// GtkImageLoader, and porting <Image> to macOS was the point at which "the same
// thing twice" became visible. See plan/26-macos-image.md.
