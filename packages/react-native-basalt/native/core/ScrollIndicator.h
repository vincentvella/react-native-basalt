// The scrollbar a scroll view draws over itself.
//
// None of the three hosts drew one, so a long list gave no sign of how long it
// was or where you were in it -- which on a desktop reads as a bug rather than
// a style.
//
// ## Drawn rather than borrowed
//
// Each toolkit has a scrollbar and none of them is available here. GTK's comes
// with `GtkScrolledWindow`, AppKit's `NSScroller` comes with `NSScrollView`,
// and this platform's scroll view is neither -- it is a `<View>` that moves its
// children, because that is what Fabric hands it. Adopting a toolkit scroll
// container would mean giving it the scrolling too, and then React Native and
// the toolkit would both believe they own the offset.
//
// So it is drawn, and the geometry is decided here so that all three draw the
// same thing. That also makes it testable, which is worth more than usual: a
// scrollbar is pure paint, and paint is what these hosts cannot assert.
//
// ## The shape
//
// An overlay indicator, like every modern desktop: a rounded bar inset from the
// trailing edge, sized to the fraction of the content on screen, positioned by
// how far through it you are. Not a classic scrollbar with arrows and a
// trough -- nothing here is a drag target yet, which `docs/backlog` records.
