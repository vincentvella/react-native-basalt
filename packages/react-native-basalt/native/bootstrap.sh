# have identical field offsets. `Environment` multiply-inherits from
# `VariableSizeRuntimeCell` and an *empty* base, `llvh::TrailingObjects`, and
# the MSVC ABI does not collapse empty bases the way the Itanium ABI does. So
# sizeof matches, the offsets do not, and the build stops on a static_assert
# that no flag can affect.
#
# Hermes already has the fix and does not use it. `Support/Compiler.h` defines
#
#     #define HERMES_EMPTY_BASES __declspec(empty_bases)
#
# with a comment saying it is "necessary for PointerBase alignment requirements
# in some cases when using HERMESVM_CONTIGUOUS_HEAP" -- the mode this builds in
# -- and applies it to nothing in the entire tree. This puts it on the one class
# that needs it.
#
# Patching a download is not something this project does lightly, and it is
# worth being clear about why this one is tolerable where patching React Native
# is not: third_party/hermes is a tarball this script fetched, not a checkout
# anybody works in, and --force deletes and refetches it. The real fix is

Run it from a shell that has run vcvars64.bat, or clang-cl will not find the
Windows SDK. clang-cl rather than cl: see plan/41-msvc-core.md.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not optional here, unlike on the other two desktops. Left
unset, MSVC picks the debug C runtime -- and vcpkg follows it to the debug
packages -- while Hermes above was built Release. The two cannot be linked
together: the failure is lld-link reporting a mismatch on _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL,
which names neither the build type nor the library that disagrees.
