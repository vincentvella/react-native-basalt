/**
 * `npx react-native-basalt init`, which adds a desktop to an app that exists.
 *
 * It does not create an app. `create-expo-app` does that, and the division is
 * the same one `run-linux` already assumes: this platform is something you add
 * to a React Native app, not a way to start one.
 *
 * ## Why a bin rather than a CLI command
 *
 * The run commands are React Native CLI commands, registered from the host
 * packages, because the CLI has to be able to find them. This one cannot be:
 * before it runs, the package is not a dependency yet, so there is no config
 * for the CLI to read. `npx react-native-basalt init` works from nothing, which
 * is the point -- one command, in an app that has never heard of this platform.
 *
 * ## Idempotent, and refusing beats half-configuring
 *
 * Every step reports one of three things: it was already right, it was changed,
 * or it could not be done and why. Running twice is safe and says so. An app
 * this cannot recognise is refused before anything is written, because a
 * half-configured app fails later and further from the cause than one that was
 * turned away -- and the failure it produces names a Metro or Babel internal
 * rather than the step that was skipped.
