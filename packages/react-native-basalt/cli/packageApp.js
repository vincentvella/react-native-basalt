/**
 * Turning a host binary into the thing each desktop calls an application.
 *
 * `--build` produces an executable, and an executable is not an application on
 * any of these three. What it costs to stay a bare binary is not cosmetic:
 *
 *   macOS    `UNUserNotificationCenter` does not merely fail for a process with
 *            no bundle identifier -- it raises `bundleProxyForCurrentProcess is
 *            nil` and terminates. So notifications are unreachable, and so are
 *            the Dock icon, the menu bar name, file associations and a
 *            registered URL scheme, all of which live in the same `Info.plist`.
 *
 *   Linux    Notifications work without one, because the D-Bus service takes
 *            the name in the call. What a `.desktop` file adds is identity: the
 *            app's icon beside its notifications, its name in the switcher, and
 *            `x-scheme-handler/` so a link opens it.
 *
 *   Windows  A toast needs an AppUserModelID and a Start Menu shortcut carrying
 *            it. Both are done by the host itself rather than from here -- a
 *            `.lnk` with that property set means `IPropertyStore`, which is
 *            COM, and doing it in C++ at startup is simpler than doing it in
 *            PowerShell from Node. See win32/Win32Packaging.h.
 *
 * So this file is macOS and Linux, and Windows is a no-op that says why.
 *
 * ## The macOS bundle is not only for release
 *
 * `NSBundle.mainBundle` comes from where the executable *is*, not from how it
 * was launched. An executable at `Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo` is bundled even
 * when run straight from a shell -- so packaging on every run, including a
 * development one, is what makes `Notification` behave the same in both. The
 * copy is skipped when the binary has not changed, which is what keeps that
 * from costing forty megabytes a run.
