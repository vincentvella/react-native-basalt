/**
 * A second window.
 *
 *   <Window title="Preview" width={600} height={400} onClose={hide}>
 *     <Preview id={id} />
 *   </Window>
 *
 * Mount it and a window opens; unmount it and the window closes. React Native
 * has no API for this because a phone has one window and it is the screen.
 *
 * ## A window is a React root
 *
 * That is Fabric's grain rather than a decision this makes: a surface is what
 * has a size, a layout context and a root shadow node, and two windows sharing
 * one would be two windows sharing a layout. So a second window runs a second
 * React tree, and `<Window>`'s children are rendered *there* rather than where
 * they were written.
 *
 * Which has a consequence worth stating plainly, because it is the one thing
 * that will surprise people: **the children do not see React context from the
 * tree they were written in.** A theme provider, a navigation container or a
 * Redux store wrapping the `<Window>` is not wrapping its children. What does
 * cross is props -- the elements themselves are passed through, so anything
 * captured in a closure or given as a prop arrives intact, including state and
 * callbacks:
 *
 *   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 *   <Window><Text onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</Text></Window>
 *
 * works, and re-renders the window when `count` changes. A `useContext` inside
 * `<Preview>` does not. An app that needs context in a window should pass the
 * value as a prop and re-provide it inside.
 *
 * ## `onClose`
 *
 * Called when the *person* closed the window -- its own close button, or the
 * window manager -- and not when the app unmounted the `<Window>`. An app that
 * unmounted it already knows.
 *
 * It is the half that keeps the two sides agreeing: without it an app's `open`
 * flag would stay true after the window had gone, the next render would try to
 * close a window that closed itself, and the window could never be reopened.
 *
 * `useWindow()` inside a second window's tree still reports the *active*
 * window, not the one it is in; that is a real gap and is in plan/backlog.md.
 *
