/**
 * `ScrollView`, for a desktop React Native platform.
 *
 * Unlike the other four overrides beside this one, this is not a rewrite: it is
 * React Native's own `ScrollView`, with the one line that drops `refreshControl`
 * on the floor put back.
 *
 * `ScrollView.render` handles the prop in two branches -- iOS puts the control
 * inside the scroll view, Android wraps the scroll view in one -- and has no
 * `else`. Bundle for `linux`, `macos` or `windows` and neither branch is taken,
 * so `<ScrollView refreshControl={...}>` renders the list and silently no
 * refresh control: no warning, no error, nothing on screen, and a
 * `<RefreshControl>` that is never mounted and so can never fire `onRefresh`.
 *
 * A wrapper rather than a copy. `ScrollView.js` is two thousand lines and every
 * one of them would have to be re-copied at each React Native upgrade; the part
 * that is wrong here is a single decision about where one child goes, and the
 * iOS arrangement -- the control as a child of the scroll view -- is the one
 * this platform implements. So the control is passed through as an ordinary
 * first child and everything else is React Native's.
 *
 * Importing the module this file replaces resolves to the original rather than
 * looping: `metro-config.js` skips the override when the request comes from the
 * override itself. That guard was written for exactly this case.
 *
