/**
 * `setUpDeveloperTools`, for a desktop React Native platform.
 *
 * React Native's own file, with one thing added: a listener that lets the host
 * drive the developer menu.
 *
 * Of the three things that menu does, two need nothing from here.
 * `toggleElementInspector` is React Native's own device event and
 * `AppContainer-dev.js` already listens for it; `openDebugger` is a method on
 * `ReactHost`. Reload is the odd one out, and the reason this override exists:
 * it lives on `ReactHost::reloadReactInstance`, which is private, and the only
 * thing wired to it is the callback React Native's `DevSettings` module holds.
 * So the host asks JavaScript to make the call, and this is what hears it.
 *
 * Why here rather than in a module an app imports: this file runs from
 * `InitializeCore` in every development bundle, before any application code,
 * and an app that imports nothing from `react-native-basalt` still gets a
 * working dev menu. That is also why it is a copy of upstream plus a listener
 * rather than something of our own -- the file has to keep doing its own job.
 *
 * The upstream half is deliberately unmodified. When it changes, this should be
 * recopied rather than merged: everything below the marker is ours and
 * everything above it is React Native's.
