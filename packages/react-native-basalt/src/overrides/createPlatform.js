/**
 * `Platform`, for a desktop React Native platform.
 *
 * React Native ships `Platform.android.js` and `Platform.ios.js`, and a
 * `Platform.js` whose entire body is `import Platform from './Platform'` -- a
 * shim that exists so deep imports keep working, and which relies on a
 * platform-specific file winning the resolution. Bundle for a platform React
 * Native has never heard of and that import resolves to the shim itself, so
 * `Platform.constants` comes out undefined and the first thing to touch it
 * dies:
 *
 *     TypeError: Cannot read property 'isDisableAnimations' of undefined
 *
 * So a `Platform` has to exist for each of them, and `metro-config.js` is what
 * puts it in the shim's place.
 *
 * The only thing that differs between linux, macos and windows is the string.
 * Three copies of this file would be three chances for them to drift, and the
 * drift would be silent -- so there is one implementation and three two-line
 * modules beside it, which is also what makes `Platform.select` behave
 * identically on all three without anybody having to check.
 *
 * Constants come from `NativePlatformConstantsAndroid`. That is not a
 * placeholder: ReactCxxPlatform's PlatformConstantsModule genuinely returns
 * `PlatformConstantsAndroid`, so this is the spec the native side implements,
 * on every desktop.
 *
