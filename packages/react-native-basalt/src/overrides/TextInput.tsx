/**
 * `<TextInput>`, for every desktop platform here.
 *
 * React Native's own `TextInput.js` cannot be used here. Its body is
 *
 *     if (Platform.OS === 'android') { ... }
 *     else if (Platform.OS === 'ios') { ... }
 *
 * and on any other platform neither branch runs, so the component it goes on to
 * render is undefined and React reports an invalid element type. There is no
 * third branch to add without forking fifteen hundred lines of iOS and Android
 * behaviour that would then drift from upstream in silence.
 *
 * So this is a smaller implementation, and honestly a subset. It renders the
 * same native component the iOS path renders, `RCTSinglelineTextInputView`,
 * which ReactCommon rewrites to the component named `TextInput`, whose shadow
 * node is React Native's own iOS one and whose measurement runs through
 * whichever text layout manager the platform installs -- Pango on Linux, Core
 * Text on macOS and DirectWrite on Windows, all three of which mount it. What
 * it does not carry is the years of platform-specific behaviour in the real
 * file: no `InputAccessoryView`, no shared `TextInputState` focus registry, no
 * autofill, no `rejectResponderTermination`, no multiline.
 *
 * `selection` and `onSelectionChange` do work, and need nothing here: both
 * reach the native component through `...rest`, and what was missing was the
 * native half on either side of them.
 *
 * `docs/BACKLOG.md` tracks what is missing. The seam is here when it is time.
