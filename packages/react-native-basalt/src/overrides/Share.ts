/**
 * `Share`, for a platform React Native's own copy does not have a branch for.
 *
 * Not a shim and not a subset: this is a rewrite, for the same reason
 * TextInput.js is one. React Native's `Share.share()` branches on `Platform.OS`
 * being exactly `android` or `ios` and ends with
 *
 *     return Promise.reject(new Error('Unsupported platform'));
 *
 * so on a desktop the native module was never reached, and implementing one
 * changed nothing at all. A third branch upstream would be the tidier fix and
 * is not ours to make; until then the file is replaced, and the replacement is
 * deliberately close to the original so a diff against it stays short.
 *
 * ## Which of the two shapes this follows
 *
 * Android's. React Native has two: a promise-returning `ShareModule.share`, and
 * an iOS callback pair on `ActionSheetManager`. The first is the one whose
 * signature matches what `Share.share()` returns, so the desktop module is
 * shaped like it -- see core/CoreModules.h.
 *
 * It takes one thing more than Android's does: `url`. React Native marks that
 * as iOS-only, and a desktop has no reason to refuse it -- a link with a
 * sentence about it is what most calls to Share are, and dropping either half
 * would be dropping half of what the app asked for.
 *
 * ## What the platforms do with it
 *
 * macOS shows `NSSharingServicePicker`, which is the real thing. Linux and
 * Windows show a small picker built from a clipboard and a mail client, because
 * Linux has no share service at all and Windows' needs WinRT interop that is
 * not written yet. See native/core/ShareFallback.h, which argues for that being
 * the honest answer rather than a rejection.
