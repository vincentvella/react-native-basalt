/**
 * `RefreshControl`, for a desktop React Native platform.
 *
 * Not a shim. React Native's own file branches on `Platform.OS === 'ios'` with
 * an `else` that renders `AndroidSwipeRefreshLayout` -- a component whose
 * shadow node needs fbjni and which no desktop registers -- so on `linux`,
 * `macos` or `windows` the app mounts a component nothing can put on screen.
 * That is the third time this has happened (`TextInput`, `Alert`, `Share`), and
 * the answer here is the same: render the iOS-shaped component, which is
 * ordinary portable C++ all the way down.
 *
 * Two differences from the original, both deliberate.
 *
 * The imperative `setNativeRefreshing` command is gone. It exists because
 * UIKit's own refresh control moves on its own and has to be told to stop; the
 * desktop control draws only what `refreshing` says, so the prop is the only
 * path and the controlled-component bookkeeping has nothing to do.
 *
 * The control has a height while it is refreshing and none otherwise. On a
 * phone the spinner lives in the rubber band above the list, which a desktop
 * scroll view does not have; here it takes a row at the top of the content and
 * gives it back, which is what a web app does and what the pull gesture in
 * `core/PullToRefresh.h` is counting towards. The number matches
 * `kRefreshControlHeight` there.
 *
