/**
 * `Alert`, for a platform React Native's own copy has no branch for.
 *
 * The same problem `Share.js` has, in a module this project believed was
 * finished. `Alert.alert()` reads
 *
 *     if (Platform.OS === 'ios') { ... } else if (Platform.OS === 'android') { ... }
 *
 * with no `else`, so on a desktop it returns having done nothing at all -- no
 * dialog, no error, no warning. `AlertManager` was implemented in phase 32 and
 * was never once reached; js/alert.js logs "showing the alert" and then asserts
 * only that the main queue kept running, which it does whether or not anything
 * appeared. Found while implementing Share, which fails the same way for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * ## Two breaks, not one
 *
 * Fixing `Alert.js` alone changed nothing, because `RCTAlertManager.js` is one
 * of the self-importing shims and resolves to its `.android.js` sibling, which
 * calls `DialogManagerAndroid` -- a module this platform does not have -- and
 * returns. So this goes to `NativeAlertManager` directly.
 *
 * ## Which shape this uses
 *
 * The iOS one, because `AlertManager` is the iOS-shaped module: one method,
 * `alertWithArgs(args, callback)`, answering with an index. Android's is
 * `DialogManagerAndroid`, which is a different module this platform does not
 * have.
 *
 * With one difference, and it is the module's rather than this file's. React
 * Native's iOS path builds `buttons` as `[{0: 'Cancel'}, {1: 'Delete'}]` --
 * objects keyed by index -- and `DesktopAlertModule` reads `[{text: 'Cancel'}]`.
 * The second is the shape the rest of React Native uses for a button, and it is
 * the one kept here; nothing but this file calls that module.
 *
