// The `PlatformConstants` TurboModule, replacing ReactCxxPlatform's.
//
// ReactCxxPlatform ships one, and it hardcodes a React Native version of
// 1000.0.0 -- the placeholder `main` uses for "not a release" -- in every
// version, releases included. React Native's JavaScript compares that against
// the version the bundle was built from and, in a development build, reports
//
//     React Native version mismatch.
//     JavaScript version: 0.87.1
//     Native version: 1000.0.0
//
// which is a `console.error`, so it is noise rather than a crash, but it is
// noise that every developer on a released version would see forever, and it
// tells them to do things that will not help. So this reports the version the
// host was actually built against, which CMake reads out of React Native's own
// package.json and passes in as RN_LINUX_REACT_NATIVE_VERSION.
//
// Worth reporting upstream: nothing in ReactCxxPlatform can match a release
// while that constant is baked in.
//
// Everything else is copied from ReactCxxPlatform's implementation, including
// the Android-shaped fields, because that is the spec this platform answers.
// See packages/react-native-linux/src/overrides/Platform.linux.js for why the
// Android spec is the right one here.
