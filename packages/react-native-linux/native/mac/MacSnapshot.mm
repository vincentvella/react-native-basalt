// The hierarchy needs a window, and the window needs to have displayed once.
// AppKit does not attach a subview's layer to its superview's layer when the
// subview is added -- it assembles the layer tree during a display cycle, and a
// view with no window never has one. Without this the snapshot comes out as the
// root's background colour and nothing else, which reads as "the children did
// not paint" rather than "the children are not in the layer tree". The window is
// never ordered front, so nothing appears on screen.
//
// The render goes through the layer tree rather than `cacheDisplayInRect:`,
// because these views draw nothing themselves: every prop the view layer
// supports is a CALayer property, so `renderInContext:` is what actually
// exercises the code under test.
