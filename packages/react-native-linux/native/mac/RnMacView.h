// The macOS view layer: an NSView that Fabric's mounting can drive.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as the GTK one in `gtk/RnView.h` -- a view owns a
// tag and an absolute frame, does no layout of its own, and places each child
// at the rect the shadow tree already resolved. Yoga has done the layout by the
// time a mutation arrives, and a second layout system underneath it is the
// thing to avoid, not to add.
//
// Two decisions are worth stating because they are easy to get wrong and hard
// to notice afterwards.
//
// The view is **flipped**. AppKit's default origin is bottom-left; React
// Native's is top-left, and every frame Fabric produces assumes top-left. An
// unflipped view renders a correct-looking layout upside down about its own
// centre, which reads as a mysterious ordering bug rather than a coordinate
// one.
//
// The view is **layer-backed**, and props are layer properties rather than
// drawing code. Background colour, opacity, corner radius, clipping and
// transform all exist on CALayer with the semantics React Native wants, so
// mapping onto them is both less code and closer to what the platform will do
// well. The GTK side has to compose these by hand in a snapshot; here it would
// be work to avoid using them.
