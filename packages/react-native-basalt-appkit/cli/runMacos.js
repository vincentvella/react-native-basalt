 * `run-windows`, because none of it is about a toolkit -- see the note at the
 * top of that file.
 *
 * The command name is react-native-macos', deliberately, for the same reason
 * the platform name is: an app that already knows `react-native run-macos`
 * should not have to learn a second spelling to try this one.
