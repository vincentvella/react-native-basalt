// That Skia actually renders on this host, rather than merely linking.
//
// `RNSkiaModule: Skia installed` says the bindings were constructed. It does not
// say a pixel can be drawn, and the two are a long way apart: a Metal device that
// fails to create, a GrDirectContext that comes back null, a surface that wraps a
// texture nothing can read -- each of those installs perfectly well and then
// produces nothing. So this draws a known shape into an offscreen surface and
// reads the pixels back out.
//
// Against real pixels rather than against the objects returned, for the reason
// test_appkit_image.mm gives about resize modes: a call that returned a plausible
// surface and drew nowhere would pass either way. What is asserted is where the
// ink landed.
//
// Only compiled when the build was pointed at an app that has the package, so
// these run on a developer's machine and not in CI -- which has no app and so no
// Skia. See ../../react-native-basalt/native/cmake/Skia.cmake.
