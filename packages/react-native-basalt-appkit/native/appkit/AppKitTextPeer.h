// The same seam GtkTextPeer.h is, for AppKit.
//
// A single-line field is an NSTextField and a multiline one is an NSTextView,
// and they agree on almost nothing. An NSTextField has a `stringValue`, no
// selection of its own -- the window lends it a field editor while it has
// focus -- a `placeholderString`, and a `bezeled` flag. An NSTextView has a
// `string`, owns its own selection because it *is* the editor, has no
// placeholder, and draws its background through a different property.
//
// Rather than branch at each of the twenty-eight call sites in
// AppKitTextInput.mm, they go through here. Functions over a protocol because
// RnAppKitView needs the text for its tree dump and knows nothing about either
// concrete class.
//
// Offsets are in UTF-16 units, which is what NSRange means and what
// NSAttributedString counts -- the same thing React Native's JavaScript means
// by a string index. The GTK seam says characters for the same reason: each
// platform's native unit is the one its string type uses.
