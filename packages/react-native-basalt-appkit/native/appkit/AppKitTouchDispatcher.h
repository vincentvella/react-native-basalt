// AppKit input into React Native's touch events.
//
// React Native's Pressability -- what backs <Pressable>, <TouchableOpacity> and
// every onPress in an app -- runs on the responder system in JavaScript, and the
// responder system is fed by touchstart/touchmove/touchend. So a pointer on a
// desktop is reported here as a single touch point, which is also what React
// Native for Windows and macOS do. W3C pointer events exist alongside these and
// are only consulted for hover, behind a feature flag.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as react-native-basalt-gtk's GtkTouchDispatcher,
// down to the state machine and the event construction, because the part that
// is easy to get subtly different -- which touches are in `touches` versus
// `changedTouches`, and which view a gesture is reported against -- is not
// about the toolkit at all. If the two ever diverge, an app's onPress will fire
// on one desktop and not the other.
