// Turning React Native's AttributedString into something Core Text can lay out.
//
// The counterpart of react-native-basalt-gtk's PangoTextLayout, and it exists
// for the same reason: this is the one place that knows both halves, and it is
// deliberately used by both sides of the text problem.
//
//   - `TextLayoutManager::measure` (CoreTextLayoutManager.mm) builds a layout to
//     ask Core Text how big the text is, so Yoga can lay it out.
//   - `AppKitMountingManager` builds the same layout and hands it to the view,
//     which draws it.
//
// Measuring and painting must agree, so they must not build layouts
// differently. Sharing this is what guarantees that.
//
// Unlike the Pango side, nothing here needs a mutex. Core Text is documented as
// thread-safe, and Fabric measures on its layout thread while AppKit draws on
// the main one. Pango's font map is not, which is why that file serialises
// every call and this one does not.
//
// The paragraph object itself is in RnTextLayout.h, which has no React Native in
// it, so the view layer can draw one without depending on React Native.
