// Keyboard focus, for everything that is not a <TextInput>.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as react-native-basalt-gtk's GtkFocusManager,
// down to what makes a view focusable and what activating one dispatches,
// because none of that is about the toolkit: if the two diverge, an app's
// buttons will be reachable from the keyboard on one desktop and not the other.
//
// ## What makes a view focusable
//
// `accessible`. React Native has a `focusable` prop and it does not reach this
// platform: ReactCommon parses it only into Android's and tvOS's
// `HostPlatformViewProps`, and the C++ host's is a bare alias of
// `BaseViewProps`. So the signal has to be something that does arrive, and
// `accessible` is both the nearest true thing and the right one -- it is what
// `<Pressable>` sets on everything it renders, and what a screen reader already
// stops on.
//
// ## What activating one does
//
// Dispatches `topClick` with an empty payload, which is what React Native for
// Android does from `ReactViewManager.setFocusable`. Pressability listens for
// it and calls `onPress`, but only when the payload has no `pointerType` -- a
// click that came from a pointer would fire `onPress` twice. So this cannot go
// through `TouchEventEmitter::onClick`, which always carries one.
//
// ## The chain, which AppKit does not contribute
//
// This is the one place the two desktops genuinely differ. GTK hands over its
// focus chain: a focusable widget joins the window's order and Tab works. AppKit
// has a key-view loop and it is not usable here -- `selectNextKeyView:` needs
// `nextKeyView` links or `autorecalculatesKeyViewLoop`, both of which assume a
// window built from a nib, and a programmatically built one with neither simply
// does nothing. Which is exactly what it did: seven Tab presses, no focus.
//
// So the order is walked here, in tree order, which is what GTK's chain
// produces anyway. A <TextInput> is a stop like any other: the responder for
// one is its NSTextField peer rather than the view, because that is the thing
// AppKit will make first responder.
