/**
 * `react-native run-windows`.
 *
 * Four strings and a path. Everything a desktop run actually does is in
 * react-native-basalt's cli/desktop.js, shared with `run-linux` and
 * `run-macos`, because none of it is about a toolkit -- see the note at the top
 * of that file.
 *
 * The command name is react-native-windows', deliberately: an app that already
 * knows `react-native run-windows` should not have to learn a second spelling
 * to try this one. Same argument as the `windows` platform name.
