// Win32 mouse messages into React Native's touch events.
//
// React Native's Pressability -- what backs <Pressable>, <TouchableOpacity> and
// every onPress in an app -- runs on the responder system in JavaScript, and the
// responder system is fed by touchstart/touchmove/touchend. So a pointer on a
// desktop is reported here as a single touch point, which is also what React
// Native for Windows and macOS do. W3C pointer events exist alongside these and
// are only consulted for hover, behind a feature flag.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as the GTK and AppKit dispatchers, down to the
// state machine and the event construction, because the part that is easy to
// get subtly different -- which touches are in `touches` versus
// `changedTouches`, and which view a gesture is reported against -- is not
// about the toolkit at all. If the three ever diverge, an app's onPress will
// fire on two desktops and not the third.
//
// What is different here is what the toolkit does *not* provide. GTK has
// `gtk_widget_pick` and AppKit has `-hitTest:`, so on those two the dispatcher
// asks the toolkit which widget was pressed. A Win32 view is a plain C++
// object with no window of its own, so the whole of hit testing is this
// project's: `hitTest` in RnWin32View.h, which this calls. The same is true of
// capture -- AppKit and GTK route the drag to the widget that took the press
// for free, and here the host has to call SetCapture.
