// Windows' half of core/ColorScheme.h -- light or dark, as the system has it.
//
// The answer lives in the registry rather than in an API: Windows exposes the
// app theme as `AppsUseLightTheme` under the Personalize key, and there is no
// Win32 function that returns it. WinRT has UISettings, which would be a
// heavier dependency for one boolean and is unavailable in a plain Win32
// process without an apartment. The registry value is what every desktop
// framework reads, and it is what Explorer writes when the setting changes.
//
// Note the sense: the value is "apps use *light* theme", so 1 is light and 0 is
// dark, and an absent value means light -- which is the pre-2018 behaviour and
// still the right default.
