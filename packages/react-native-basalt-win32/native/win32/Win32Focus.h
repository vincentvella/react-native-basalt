// Keyboard focus, for everything that is not a <TextInput>.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as react-native-basalt-gtk's GtkFocusManager and
// the AppKit one, down to what makes a view focusable and what activating one
// dispatches, because none of that is about the toolkit: if the three diverge,
// an app's buttons will be reachable from the keyboard on some desktops and not
// others.
//
// ## What makes a view focusable
//
// `accessible`. React Native has a `focusable` prop and it does not reach this
// platform: ReactCommon parses it only into Android's and tvOS's
// `HostPlatformViewProps`, and the C++ host's is a bare alias of
// `BaseViewProps`. So the signal has to be something that does arrive, and
// `accessible` is both the nearest true thing and the right one -- it is what
// `<Pressable>` sets on everything it renders, and what a screen reader already
// stops on.
//
// ## What activating one does
//
// Dispatches `topClick` with an empty payload, which is what React Native for
// Android does from `ReactViewManager.setFocusable`. Pressability listens for
// it and calls `onPress`, but only when the payload has no `pointerType` -- a
// click that came from a pointer would fire `onPress` twice. So this cannot go
// through `TouchEventEmitter::onClick`, which always carries one.
//
// ## The chain, all of which is here
//
// The other two desktops have something to start from. GTK hands over its focus
// chain outright; AppKit has a key-view loop that turned out to be unusable for
// a window built without a nib, but at least has a first responder to ask about.
// Here a React Native view is not a window at all -- it is a C++ object painted
// with Direct2D -- so there is nothing for Windows to focus and nothing to ask.
// The order, the current stop, the ring and the key handling are all this file's.
//
// The exception is a <TextInput>, whose peer *is* a real child window. Focus
// there is Win32 focus, moved with SetFocus and reported by EN_SETFOCUS, so a
// field is a stop in the same order as the buttons around it and the two kinds
// of focus have to be kept from being held at once.
