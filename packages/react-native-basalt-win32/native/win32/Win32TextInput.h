// <TextInput> on Win32.
//
// The native half is React Native's own *iOS* TextInput: its shadow node,
// props, state and event emitter are pure C++ and measure through a
// TextLayoutManager, which on this platform is the DirectWrite one. Android's
// variant includes fbjni and calls into a Java FabricUIManager, so it is
// unusable here; see plan/decisions.md. The component name is therefore
// "TextInput", which is what packages/react-native-basalt's
// src/overrides/TextInput.js asks for -- the same file both other desktops use,
// because that override was never about Linux.
//
// The editing itself is a real EDIT control, not a caret drawn on a DirectWrite
// layout. That brings the IME, selection, the clipboard, undo, double-click
// word selection, Ctrl+arrow, and every other binding a Windows user expects --
// none of it worth reimplementing and all of it easy to get subtly wrong. GTK
// embeds a GtkText and AppKit an NSTextField for exactly the same reason.
//
// ## The peer is a window, and that is the whole difficulty
//
// On the other two desktops a React Native view *is* a widget, so a text field
// is a widget inside a widget and the toolkit handles the rest. Here every view
// is a plain C++ object painted with Direct2D into one HWND, and an EDIT is a
// real child window. Three consequences follow, and none of them has an
// equivalent on GTK or AppKit:
//
//   - **It has to be positioned by hand.** The manager walks the view up to the
//     surface root to find its rectangle in client coordinates, and has to redo
//     that whenever anything moves it -- which includes a scroll, where no
//     mutation arrives at all. `syncBounds` is that, and the host calls it after
//     every transaction and every wheel.
//
//   - **It is always on top.** Child windows paint above whatever Direct2D drew,
//     in an order the React tree has no say in. A field cannot be covered by a
//     later sibling, and it does not clip to a scrolled ancestor -- it is hidden
//     when it leaves the ancestor's box instead, which is close enough to look
//     right and is not the same thing.
//
//   - **Its events arrive at the parent.** EN_CHANGE, EN_SETFOCUS and
//     EN_KILLFOCUS are WM_COMMAND notifications to the host window, and the
//     text and background colours are answered from WM_CTLCOLOREDIT. So the
//     host forwards both, which is why this class has methods a mounting
//     manager would not otherwise need.
//
// ## The controlled-value loop, which is not about a toolkit
//
// React Native's <TextInput> is controlled: JavaScript owns the value, the
// control reports every change, JavaScript re-renders and pushes the value back
// down as a prop. If applying that prop looks like the user typing, the two
// chase each other forever. If a prop that arrives late is applied anyway, a
// fast typist watches characters reorder themselves.
//
// `applying` breaks the first and `eventCount` the second, exactly as on both
// other desktops, because neither is a Windows problem.
