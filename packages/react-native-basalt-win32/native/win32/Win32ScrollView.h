// <ScrollView> on Win32.
//
// Yoga does the hard part. A ScrollView's Yoga node carries `overflow: scroll`,
// which lets its child exceed the viewport instead of being clamped to it, so
// by the time a mutation arrives the content is already laid out at its full
// size and the only thing missing is the offset.
//
// Structure: a mounted ScrollView has exactly **one** child, a content view.
// React Native's JS wraps the children in an `RCTScrollContentView`, which the
// C++ registry rewrites to a plain `View`, so no extra descriptor is needed and
// nothing here should expect N children.
//
// Scrolling is `RnWin32View::setScrollOffset`, which shifts children while
// painting rather than moving them. The frames the mounting manager wrote stay
// exactly the ones Yoga produced, nothing has to be undone on the next
// mutation, and `hitTest` adds the same offset back on the way down -- so
// picking follows the scroll without knowing what a ScrollView is. GTK reaches
// the same place by shifting children in its layout manager and AppKit by
// moving `bounds.origin`.
//
// Two things must happen on every scroll, and they are not the same thing:
//
//   - `onScroll` goes to JavaScript, throttled by `scrollEventThrottle`. Without
//     it VirtualizedList never renders past its first window.
//   - `contentOffset` is written back into `ScrollViewState`, unthrottled.
//     `ScrollViewShadowNode::getContentOriginOffset` reads it, and through that
//     so do `measure`, `measureLayout`, C++ hit testing and view culling. Skip
//     it and those all silently report unscrolled coordinates.
//
// All of that is the same on all three desktops, which is why this file reads
// like GtkScrollView.cpp with different event plumbing.
//
// ## What is different here
//
// **Routing.** GTK attaches a `GtkEventControllerScroll` per widget and AppKit
// walks the responder chain; both get "a wheel over a row scrolls the list
// containing it, and a list inside a list scrolls the inner one first" for
// free. A Win32 view has no window of its own and there is no chain to walk, so
// `scrollAt` does it: hit test for the view under the pointer, then walk up
// parents offering the wheel to each ScrollView until one takes it. The first
// that does is the innermost, which is the same answer the other two get.
//
// **Drag phases.** GTK's controller reports scroll-begin and scroll-end, and
// AppKit's NSEvent carries a phase. Win32 has neither: `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` is a
// bare notch with nothing around it. So a run of wheel messages is treated as
// one drag, ended by a short idle timeout -- see `kWheelIdleMs`. Without that
// there would be no `onScrollBeginDrag` or `onScrollEndDrag` on this platform
// at all, and the components that wait for them would wait forever.
//
// What Windows does not have: momentum. `onMomentumScrollBegin` and
// `onMomentumScrollEnd` never fire here, and that is deliberate rather than
// unfinished. A precision touchpad reports `WM_MOUSEWHEEL` with fine deltas and
// no fling velocity -- inertia on Windows belongs to Direct Manipulation, which
// wants to own the viewport and so cannot be used by a platform whose whole
// invariant is that React Native decides where things go. macOS gets momentum
// from the system and GTK gets a velocity this project animates
// (core/ScrollMomentum.h); a wheel supplies neither, and modelling a fling off
// one would report a throw that never happened.
