// The Windows view layer: a view Fabric's mounting can drive.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as `gtk/RnView.h` and `appkit/RnAppKitView.h` --
// a view owns a tag and an absolute frame, does no layout of its own, and
// places each child at the rect the shadow tree already resolved. Yoga has done
// the layout by the time a mutation arrives, and a second layout system
// underneath it is the thing to avoid, not to add.
//
// Three decisions carry the weight here, and the first is the one that makes
// this platform different from the other two.
//
// **A view is not a window.** On GTK a view is a GtkWidget and on macOS an
// NSView; the obvious Windows translation is a child HWND per view, and it is
// wrong. An HWND is a kernel object with a message queue association, USER32
// caps a process at ten thousand of them by default, and a list of a few
// hundred rows would spend the budget. Worse, none of what the analogy promises
// arrives: an HWND clips rectangularly and cannot be rotated, so `transform`
// and rounded `overflow: hidden` would both have to be reimplemented anyway.
// So the host owns one HWND for the surface, and a view is a plain C++ object
// painted by the recursive walk in `paint`. That is closer to GTK's snapshot
// than to AppKit's layer tree, and it means this file owes the platform
// nothing but Direct2D. The one place a real window is still the right answer
// is `<TextInput>`, where an EDIT peer brings input methods and every Windows
// key binding with it -- the same bargain GTK's GtkText and AppKit's
// NSTextField make.
//
// **No flip.** Win32 and Direct2D both put the origin at the top left, which is
// where React Native puts it. The AppKit side needs `isFlipped` and a test that
// states the coordinate in numbers; here the coordinate systems already agree,
// and the only reason to mention it is that a reader coming from that file will
// go looking for the flip.
//
// **Painting is immediate, not retained.** DirectComposition would give a
// visual per view, which is the closer analogue of CALayer, and it would put
// transform and opacity in the compositor. It would also make the offscreen
// snapshot -- the thing that proves this layer paints correctly at all -- a
// second, separate path. One Direct2D walk renders identically to a window and
// to a WIC bitmap, so the picture the tests compare is made by the same code
// that draws the app.
