// Rendering a view tree without showing it -- to a PNG, or to pixels a test can
// read.
//
// The PNG is shared by the demo and, later, the mount harness, and it is the
// only way either of them proves anything: a tree dump prints the frames that
// were *set*, which looks identical whether or not the transform composition,
// the clip and the paint order are right. A picture does not.
//
// The pixels are the same render with the encoder left off, and they exist
// because of a gap `plan/backlog.md` has carried since GTK: "the widget tree
// says a view has a colour and a frame, not that the right pixels reached the
// screen -- GTK's cairo renderer mangled every transform in the demo and no
// test noticed". Neither of the other hosts can close that cheaply. GTK needs a
// display server and macOS needs an offscreen NSWindow and a display cycle;
// Direct2D renders into a WIC bitmap with no window, no device and no display,
// so on this platform a rendering assertion costs a function call. That is also
// what lets the Windows suite run on a headless CI machine with none of the
// xvfb arrangement `docs/TESTING.md` describes for GTK.
