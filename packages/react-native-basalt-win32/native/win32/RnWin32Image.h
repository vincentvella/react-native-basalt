// Device-independent on purpose. Direct2D's own ID2D1Bitmap belongs to the
// render target that made it, so holding one would tie an image to a window and
// make it useless to the offscreen snapshot -- and would have to be rebuilt
// whenever a device is lost. A WIC bitmap is the Windows equivalent of GTK's
// GdkTexture and macOS's CGImage: decoded once, owned by nobody in particular,
// converted to a device bitmap at paint time and cached there.
//
// Only the decode and the draw are here. Fetching the bytes -- file, data URI,
// http -- is `core/ImageBytes.cpp` in the shared half, because a URI means the
// same thing on every desktop; see `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
