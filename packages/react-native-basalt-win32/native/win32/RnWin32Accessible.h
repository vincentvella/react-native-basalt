// What a screen reader is told about a view.
//
// This is the one place Windows is structurally different from the other two
// desktops rather than differently spelled. GTK and AppKit both take
// accessibility as *properties on a view*: `gtk_accessible_update_property`,
// `setAccessibilityRole:`. UI Automation inverts that -- it asks a *provider*
// object questions, and the provider answers by property id. So where the other
// two mounting managers push, this one has to be ready to be pulled.
//
// The consequence worth knowing: a GTK role is construct-only, which is why
// `plan/decisions.md` records that `accessibilityRole` cannot change after
// mount there. Nothing here has that constraint, because nothing is baked into
// a widget class -- the provider reads the current value each time it is asked.
// This platform can therefore do something GTK cannot, and the mounting manager
// should not copy GTK's restriction when it arrives.
//
// What is here is the property half, which is all of it that can exist before
// there is an HWND: UIA's tree navigation needs a fragment root, and a fragment
// root is a window. `IRawElementProviderFragment` and the `Toggle`,
// `SelectionItem` and `ExpandCollapse` *patterns* therefore land with the host.
// The states those patterns expose are answerable now, because UIA mirrors each
// of them as a plain property id, and that is what these answer.
