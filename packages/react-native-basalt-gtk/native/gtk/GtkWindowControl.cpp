// The Linux half of core/WindowControl.h.
//
// GTK4 is the most opinionated of the three desktops about this, and several of
// these functions are shaped by what it will not do. `windowCapabilities()` is
// how an app finds that out without reading this file.
//
// **A window cannot be positioned.** `gtk_window_move` is gone in GTK4 and
// nothing replaced it: on Wayland a client has no idea where its window is and
// no way to say, and GTK removed the X11 call rather than ship an API that
// works on one display server. So `setWindowPosition` and the `x`/`y` in
// `windowBounds` are honest zeroes, and `centerWindow` is the window manager's
// job -- which, on both display servers, it does by default for a window that
// has not been placed.
//
// **A window's size is a request.** `gtk_window_set_default_size` is what a
// client has; the compositor may ignore it. That is also true of the other two
// desktops in a tiling window manager, and the answer is the same: ask, and
// report what actually happened through the bounds listener.
//
// **A window has no maximum size and does not float.**
// `gtk_window_set_geometry_hints` and `gtk_window_set_keep_above` were both
// removed in GTK4, for the same reason as `gtk_window_move`: Wayland has no
// protocol for either, and an API that worked on X11 alone would be one that
// silently does nothing half the time -- which is the thing GTK4 decided not to
// ship. A minimum *is* expressible, because it is a property of the widget
// rather than a request to the compositor.
