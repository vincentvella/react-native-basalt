// <TextInput> on GTK4.
//
// The native half is React Native's own *iOS* TextInput: its shadow node,
// props, state and event emitter are pure C++ and measure through a
// TextLayoutManager, which on this platform is the Pango one. Android's variant
// includes fbjni and calls into a Java FabricUIManager, so it is unusable here;
// see plan/decisions.md. The component name is therefore "TextInput", which is
// what packages/react-native-basalt' src/overrides/TextInput.js asks for.
//
// The editing itself is a real GtkText -- the widget behind GtkEntry -- rather
// than a cursor drawn on a PangoLayout. That brings input methods, selection,
// the clipboard, and every keybinding a Linux user expects, none of which is
// worth reimplementing and all of which is easy to get subtly wrong.
//
// The awkward part of a text field is not typing, it is that React Native's
// <TextInput> is a controlled component: JavaScript owns the value, and the
// widget must not fight it. Every `changed` signal is reported to JavaScript,
// which re-renders and sends the text back down as a prop -- so applying that
// prop must not itself look like the user typing, or the two chase each other.
// `applying_` is what breaks that loop.

    // re-sends `mostRecentEventCount` on every change and that alone produces
    // an Update mutation.
