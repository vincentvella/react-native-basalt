// Keyboard focus, for everything that is not a <TextInput>.
//
// A text field takes focus because it is a real GtkText and GTK gives it focus;
// nothing else in a React Native tree was reachable by Tab at all, and an
// application whose buttons cannot be reached from the keyboard is not really a
// desktop application.
//
// ## What makes a view focusable
//
// `accessible`. React Native has a `focusable` prop and it does not reach this
// platform: ReactCommon parses it only into Android's and tvOS's
// `HostPlatformViewProps`, and the C++ host's is a bare alias of
// `BaseViewProps`. So the signal has to be something that does arrive, and
// `accessible` is both the nearest true thing and the right one -- it is what
// `<Pressable>` sets on everything it renders, what an app sets on anything
// else it means as a control, and what a screen reader already stops on. Tab
// order following the accessibility tree is also what GTK and macOS do with
// their own widgets.
//
// ## What activating one does
//
// Dispatches `topClick` with an empty payload, which is exactly what React
// Native for Android does from `ReactViewManager.setFocusable`. Pressability
// listens for it and calls `onPress`, but only when the payload has no
// `pointerType` -- a click that came from a pointer would fire `onPress` twice.
// So this cannot go through `TouchEventEmitter::onClick`, which always carries
// one; it is `dispatchEvent("click", folly::dynamic::object())`, the same shape
// Android's ViewGroupClickEvent has.
//
// Enter and space, because those are the two keys that activate a control on
// every desktop and in the browser.
//
// ## What GTK contributes
//
// The chain. A focusable widget joins the window's focus order, so Tab and
// Shift+Tab already work and nothing here decides what "next" means -- which
// also means a <TextInput>'s peer sits in the same order as the buttons around
// it, without this file knowing that text inputs exist. The Win32 host has no
// such chain and has to build one; that is the difference between the two, and
// it is GTK's to take credit for.
