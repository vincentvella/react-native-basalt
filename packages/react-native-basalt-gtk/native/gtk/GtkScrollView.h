// <ScrollView> on GTK4.
//
// Yoga does the hard part. A ScrollView's Yoga node carries `overflow: scroll`,
// which lets its child exceed the viewport instead of being clamped to it, so
// by the time a mutation arrives the content is already laid out at its full
// size and the only thing missing is the offset.
//
// Structure: a mounted ScrollView has exactly **one** child, a content view.
// React Native's JS wraps the children in an `RCTScrollContentView`, which the
// C++ registry rewrites to a plain `View` (`componentNameByReactViewName`), so
// no extra descriptor is needed and nothing here should expect N children.
//
// Scrolling is expressed as an offset on the ScrollView's own RnView rather
// than by a GtkScrolledWindow. GtkScrolledWindow wants to size its child
// through the measure/allocate protocol, and this platform's whole invariant is
// that React Native decides sizes and the layout manager only places things.
// Shifting children in `RnLayout::allocate` keeps that invariant and makes GTK's
// hit testing follow the scroll for free.
//
// Two things must happen on every scroll, and they are not the same thing:
//
//   - `onScroll` goes to JavaScript, throttled by `scrollEventThrottle`. Without
//     it VirtualizedList never renders past its first window.
//   - `contentOffset` is written back into `ScrollViewState`, unthrottled.
//     `ScrollViewShadowNode::getContentOriginOffset` reads it, and through that
//     so do `measure`, `measureLayout`, C++ hit testing and view culling. Skip
//     it and those all silently report unscrolled coordinates.
