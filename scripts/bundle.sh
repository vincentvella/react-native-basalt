# Builds the demo app into a Metro bundle the host can load.
#
# Usage:  scripts/bundle.sh [/path/to/react-native] [--dev|--prod] [--platform P]
#                          [--build-dir DIR] [--entry FILE] [--out NAME]
#
# Produces a production bundle by default. A --dev one does load and run since
# phase 32 -- a __DEV__ bundle pulls in LogBox, which reads the DevSettings
# TurboModule at module scope, and until this project supplied one outside dev
# mode that import took the app down. What it still does not get you is a
# development *mode*: nothing reloads it and nothing refreshes it, and LogBox's
# own images are not among the assets copied next to it.
#
# Development is Metro plus BASALT_DEV=1, not a --dev bundle:
#
#   scripts/metro.sh ../react-native
#   BASALT_DEV=1 ./build/basalt_gtk build/main.jsbundle.js BasaltDemo
#
# Built for the `linux` platform: packages/react-native-basalt supplies the
# Platform module and the Metro configuration that makes Metro resolve it, so
# an app sees Platform.OS === 'linux' and can use .linux.js files.
#
# --platform android still works, and is what this built before the platform
# package existed. Useful for telling apart "broken on this platform" from
# "broken everywhere".
