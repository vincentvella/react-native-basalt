// Copies the images a bundle `require()`s to where it will look for them.
//
// Metro's `build` command has no `--assets-dest`. React Native's own CLI does,
// and reaching for it would mean bundling through a second tool with its own
// idea of which platforms exist -- the thing packages/react-native-basalt's
// Metro config is there to avoid. So the asset list is read back out of the
// bundle that was just written, which is where Metro puts it anyway.
//
// Every `require('./thing.png')` becomes a descriptor in the bundle:
//
//   {__packager_asset:!0,httpServerLocation:"/assets/../../react-native/...",
//    scales:[1,2,3],name:"close",type:"png",...}
//
// `httpServerLocation` is the asset's directory relative to Metro's project
// root, under a `/assets` prefix -- so the source is that path resolved against
// the project root, and the destination is the same path with each `..` turned
// into `__`, which is the escaping `resolveAssetSource` applies at runtime.
// Getting both from one string is what keeps this from having to know where
// React Native is checked out.
//
// This is what LogBox's icons needed, and it is not only LogBox's: any app with
// a `require()`d image had the same silent hole, which showed up as an <Image>
// that laid out at the right size and drew nothing.
