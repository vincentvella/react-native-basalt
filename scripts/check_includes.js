/**
 * Finds a standard header a file uses and does not include.
 *
 * This exists because of one bug that took CI down for thirteen commits.
 * `core/DevBundle.h` declared a function taking a `uint32_t` and included
 * `<optional>` and `<string>`. It compiled on Windows, because windows.h had
 * already been pulled in behind it, and on macOS for a similar reason. On Linux
 * with libstdc++ it did not, and the Linux job is the only one that builds the
 * whole thing -- so the failure was real, immediate, and invisible from the
 * machine the work was being done on.
 *
 * A compiler is the right tool for this and there is no substitute. What this
 * is instead is the cheapest possible stand-in for the *one* compiler nobody
 * developing here can run: it needs no build, no toolkit and no React Native,
 * so it can run on every platform's CI job and on a developer's machine before
 * the twenty-minute round trip.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative. It knows a short list of names whose header is
 * unambiguous, and it counts a project header included by the file as
 * providing whatever that header includes -- one level, which is enough for the
 * "the .cpp gets it from its own .h" arrangement this codebase uses everywhere.
 * A false positive costs an argument; a false negative costs what it already
 * cost once.
 *
 * Run with:  node scripts/check_includes.js
 *
 * @format
