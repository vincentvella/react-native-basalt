"""Checks on the end-to-end harness itself, for the failures that point at green.

A bug in a test harness is not like a bug in the code under test. If it makes a
wait return early or a count match something it should not, every scenario using
it passes while checking less than its name says, and nothing in the output
looks wrong. That is the class of bug here.

Both checks below are regressions:

- `wait_for_log` counted from the start of the file, and the Fast Refresh
  scenario used it to wait for Metro to serve the running app a bundle. But
  `Metro.prewarm` is itself a request and Metro logs two BUNDLE lines for it, so
  the count was already satisfied before the host was started. The wait returned
  in about a hundredth of a second, on every platform, for as long as it had
  existed. What hid it is that the edit assertion after it carried the scenario
  on the machines where Metro's file watching works.

- `stop_host` replaced a bare `terminate()`. GTK and AppKit handle SIGTERM and
  exit 0; Windows has no SIGTERM, so `terminate()` is `TerminateProcess` and the
  exit code is always 1. Asserting on it reported our own kill as the app
  crashing, the first time that scenario ran on Windows.
