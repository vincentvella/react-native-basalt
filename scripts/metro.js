// Usage:  node scripts/metro.js [/path/to/react-native] [--port 8081]
//
// Then, in another terminal:
//
//   BASALT_DEV=1 ./build/basalt_gtk
//
// This exists in Node rather than in shell because Windows has to run it too.
// scripts/metro.sh was the only way to start a packager, so the two scenarios
// that need one -- Fast Refresh and the developer menu -- skipped on the one
// desktop that had most recently gained development mode.
//
// It serves in-process rather than spawning `metro serve`, which matters for
// stopping it: a parent that spawns Metro leaves it running when it is killed
// on Windows, where terminating a process does not terminate its children. One
// process means the caller's kill is the whole of the cleanup.
//
// The host asks for "http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=...", a URL
// DevServerHelper builds from ReactInstanceConfig plus the source path. Metro
// must therefore be serving js/ as its project root, which is what the config
// below arranges.
