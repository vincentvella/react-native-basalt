# spellings of one thing.
#
# What runs depends on what is built and what is installed, and each step says
# which when it skips. Nothing here builds a host: a test run that silently
# rebuilds is a test run whose failure might be yesterday's binary.

#   scripts/test_all.sh --list       # the step names
#
# Narrowing matters: the whole thing is about a quarter of an hour per host, and
