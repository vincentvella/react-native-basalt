#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Runs the same app through every host that is built and diffs the view tree
# each produced.
#
# This is the check the whole architecture is for. The same React, the same
# Fabric, the same Yoga, and three completely different view layers underneath
# -- if the trees differ, one of the platforms is wrong, and which one is a
# question the diff answers before anybody looks at a screenshot.
#
# It checks two things, because they fail differently. The trees have to match,
# and each host has to have got the platform it asked for: a bundle built for
# the wrong platform can still render correctly and be wrong about everything
# `Platform.OS` guards.
#
# Text is the exception, and BASALT_COMPARE_IGNORE_FRAMES=1 is how to say so.
# Pango over the system sans, Core Text over San Francisco and DirectWrite over
# Segoe UI are different shapers over different fonts: the same paragraph is a
# few points taller on one than another, and every frame below it shifts.
# Demanding equality there would mean the check could never be turned on for
# text at all. With frames ignored what is still compared is everything that
# must match -- the tree shape, the strings, the colours, the clip and opacity
# flags -- which is where a real bug would show up.
#
# ## Which hosts run
#
# Whichever are built, and at least two are needed for there to be a
# comparison. That is deliberately lenient: no machine has all three. A Mac with
# GTK installed has two, a Linux box has one, and a Windows box has one -- so in
# practice this runs on a developer's machine rather than in CI, where each host
# only exists on its own side.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   scripts/compare_hosts.sh                       # the views-only React app
#   scripts/compare_hosts.sh <app> [moduleName]    # build/<app>.<platform>.jsbundle.js
#   scripts/compare_hosts.sh js/demo.js ''         # one file, every host
#
# A React app needs a bundle per platform, because the platform is baked in at
# bundle time, so an app name is given rather than a path and the per-platform
# bundles are found by convention. A raw-Fabric script does not, so a path to
# one is used for every host as it stands.
#
# BASALT_BUILD_DIR moves where both the hosts and the bundles are looked for,
# which is what a second build tree needs -- testing against another React
# Native version means a second configure, and the hosts land beside it.
