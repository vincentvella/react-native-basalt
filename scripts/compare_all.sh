# that only passes the second is one whose layout depends on text measurement,

# over Segoe UI cannot agree and never will -- so what is compared there is the
# tree shape, the strings, the colours, the roles and the flags.

# Needs at least two hosts. Bundles are built if missing, for whichever
# platforms are going to run -- inside the distro, for a Linux host in WSL.
